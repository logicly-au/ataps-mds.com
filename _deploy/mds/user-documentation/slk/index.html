    <h1>Statistical Linkages Key (SLK)</h1>
<ul id="toc"></ul>
<h2><a id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>This item has been mandatory for new referrals as of 1st June, 2013.  If you have any difficulties implementing this change please email us at <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>.</p>
<p>A new field has been introduced in the Patients record of the MDS in September 2012. This new field is labelled ‘SLK’, an acronym for ‘Statistical Linkage Key’. The purpose of the SLK is to maintain greater accuracy of patient data, within and across Primary Health Networks. The SLK provides the capacity to identify individual clients across time in order to support more accurate reporting of repeat vs new clients being serviced. This capacity also helps managers to allocate resources according to program requirements (e.g. limits to the maximum number of sessions per client per 12 month period).</p>
<p>It is important to note that an SLK is <strong>not</strong> a unique key for each patient since it is possible for a derived SLK to exactly match the derived SLK of another patient. This will only occur in a very small percentage of patients, which allows the SLK to be used for reporting purposes but not when an exact match is required. i.e. searching for a specific patient within the ATAPS MDS.</p>
<p>The SLK feature requires organisations to enter the following information into an SLK Generator within the ATAPS MDS: Family Name, First Name, Date of Birth, Gender. It is important to note that the name information will NOT be stored, it will simply serve as the combination of data from which an SLK will be generated for this patient. This SLK produced will be in de-identified form (i.e., a code). The conventions of this process are documented on the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare website:</p>

<h2><a id="Privacy_Concerns"></a>Privacy Concerns</h2>
<p>Concerns were raised that the SLK includes enough of a person's details (parts of their name, their gender, and date of birth) that they may still be identifiable. In order to alleviate this the SLK can now be provided, and is <strong>always</strong> stored as a meaningless looking string of characters via a 'hashing' algorithm similar to those used by secure computer systems to protect user passwords. For example the SLK:</p>
<p>RONOH010119701</p>
<p>gets hashed to:</p>
<p>25YA2351JSRF1CVT9CWRQXTHRBXFTTNB</p>
<p>This hashed SLK can then be compared in the same way the non-hashed SLK can.</p>
<p>The SLK can now be entered or uploaded in its hashed form. Instructions for generating SLKs for upload can be found on the <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html">Upload File Format</a> page.</p>
<p>Any data entered into the SLK generator is not stored online, it remains within the privacy of the end user's computer.</p>
<h2><a id="Instructions_on_using_the_SLK_in_the_MDS"></a> Instructions on using the SLK in the MDS</h2>
<ol>
<li>From within the Patients record, click on the ‘SLK’ link. This will open up the SLK generator.</li>
<li>Enter the following details: Family Name, First Name, Date of Birth, Gender.</li>
<li>Click on the ‘Generate SLK’ button.</li>
<li>An SLK should appear in the SLK field in your patient’s record.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, a standalone SLK generator is now available at <a href="https://ataps-mds.net/slk">https://ataps-mds.net/slk</a>.  This does not require users to log in to the MDS to use this.</p>
<h2><a id="Instructions_for_uploading_the_SLK"></a> Instructions for uploading the SLK</h2>
<p>Instructions for generating SLKs for upload can be found on the <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html">Upload File Format</a> page.</p>
<p>Test data to allow developers to test their implementation of the SLK specification can be found on the <a href="../../technical-documentation/slk-test-data-set/index.html">SLK Test Data Set</a> page.</p>
