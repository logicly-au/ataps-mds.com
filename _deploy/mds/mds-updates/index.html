    <div id="/mds/announcements/2016-06-01-UPDATE-regarding-data-collection-expectations/"><h3>UPDATE regarding data collection expectations – ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS and the PMHC MDS</h3></div>
    <h4>June 01, 2016</h4>
	<p>Hello all</p>
<p>As Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are aware, work has commenced on the design of a Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) and associated reporting arrangements.  This does not represent a ground up development but rather builds on the foundation established by the current ATAPS/MHSRRA minimum data set. </p>
<p><em>The new Mental Health Schedule states:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Department will develop specifications for a PMHC MDS and establish arrangements for reporting of data by PHNs by December 2016, using as a foundation the previous data collection and reporting arrangements established for the ATAPS and MHSRRA programs.</li>
<li>The Department will undertake this work in consultation with PHNs to ensure that all mandatory data are both relevant to monitoring achievement of the Key Objectives identified in Item B.3 subsection 1 of this Schedule and feasible for reporting.</li>
<li>Your Organisation must ensure all mandatory data is reported to the PMHC MDS as specified by the Department and achieving full compliance with reporting by 30 June 2017.</li>
</ul>
<p>This schedule requirement has raised a number of questions from PHNs with some PHNs making preparations to change their client management systems to report on ‘First Level Data Items’ outlined in the data paper provided to them on 18 March 2016. This was an initial draft and further work is being undertaken in consultation with PHNs to finalise data items and definitions.   </p>
<p><em>As such it is important that PHNs hold off on making significant changes to their existing systems until the Department releases the agreed specifications for the new PMHC MDS. This is anticipated to take place in August 2016.</em></p>
<p>The Department’s expectations for PHNs with regard to data collection are set out below. </p>
<p><em>Current Expectation:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>PHNs maintain their existing ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS whilst the redesign process is underway given the expectation that the new data collection system will build on this existing dataset.</li>
<li>PHNs maintain any other existing data sets which are anticipated to impact on their future models of mental health activity.</li>
<li>PHNs consider planning for their own future collections to inform the commissioning they anticipate undertaking. </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Future Collections:</em></p>
<p>It will remain important for both PHNs and the Department to collect data on patient services to support future activity in Australia.</p>
<p>The Department will be working with PHNs and the University of Melbourne/Strategic Data to identify data reporting and monitoring needs for all the services provided through the PHN primary mental health care flexible funding pool and develop an appropriate data collection system.  </p>
<p>This was discussed at the March PHN CEO Forum where a data paper was provided to PHNs, identifying how the MDS will be enhanced in the future to allow more flexibility for the transition of mental health activity into the PHN mental health flexible funding pool. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper invited PHNs to indicate interest and nominate representatives for a small reference group to oversee the redesign of the existing ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS to collect client information for all service streams under the flexible funding pool.</p>
<p>A number of PHNs have responded and the first meeting of the group is expected in mid to late June. </p>
<p><em>Process and timelines</em></p>
<p>The PMHC MDS will progress in stages, with initial priority to establish capacity to capture mental health nursing data previously maintained through the MHNIP session claim process administered by the Department of Human Services, along with other new service types that cannot be accommodated in the current ATAPS/MHSRRA system.</p>
<p>This is expected to be operational by October 2016 with release of an interim reporting system that will run alongside the current ATAPS/MHSRRA system. This will be followed by release in the first half of 2017 of the more comprehensive arrangement that brings together the ATAPS/MHSRRA data reporting with the new service type data.</p>
<p>This stage of development will aim to capture all client services commissioned by PHNs with the exception of those delivered through headspace centres which are covered by a specific collection managed by headspace national office. This will be considered in the second stage.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The Department appreciates that PHNs need to be aware of the specific data items they would need to report on to ensure that the commissioned services are collecting and reporting on such data items.  The Department is aiming to finalise the comprehensive specifications that define the required data by <strong>August 2016</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Communications:</em></p>
<p>Further details will be distributed and shared through the necessary stakeholder groups as they become available. </p>
<p>Alternatively should you have any immediate concerns or technical questions in regard to the collection of data for mental health please direct them to Strategic Data (responsible for the Minimum Data Set) at <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> to discuss how to manage data entry during the interim period. </p>
<p>Should you wish to provide input to the discussions you can do so by writing to <a href="mailto:PMHCSSInbox@health.gov.au">PMHCSSInbox@health.gov.au</a></p>

    <div id="/mds/announcements/2016-05-27-standard-outcome-measures/"><h3>Standard outcome measures</h3></div>
    <h4>May 27, 2016</h4>
	<p>MDS Update v4.197 was released on May 27, 2016.</p>
<p>Currently there are many outcome measures available for use on the minimum dataset. Some of the measures are either inappropriate or not commonly used by providers. Pre and post treatment scores for a given consumer on less frequently used outcome measures are excluded in statistical analyses for the national evaluation. Further, there is poor completion of the existing outcome measures. This is particularly problematic since a measure pre and post treatment is required in order to analyse consumer outcomes.</p>
<p>To this end, outcome measures are being standardised in the MDS and outcome measure compliance reports have been added. The following measures will be standard in the MDS: </p>
<ul>
<li>Kessler 10 (K10)</li>
<li>Kessler 5 (K5)</li>
<li>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)</li>
<li>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</li>
<li>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPNDS)</li>
<li>Modified Scaled for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI)</li>
</ul>
<p>All other measures will be phased out over time. Organisations can select which measures they collect within the MDS, however once a non-standard measure has been disabled, organisations will no longer be able to turn it back on.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that there are good reasons why an outcome measure may not be able to be collected. In order to allow for this a Non Completion measure has been added. This measure can be selected in lieu of another measure.</p>
<p>In order to help organisations improve their outcome measure completion and use of standard measures, three new reports have been added to the MDS. These are listed under 'Report selection &gt; Performance Indicators'.</p>
<p><strong>Referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days</strong> - By referral type, shows the number of referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days and also the number of referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days as a percentage of referrals without a conclusion. These figures are shown for three time periods - End of previous finanical year, end of last quarter and today so that organisations can track their progress over time.</p>
<p><strong>Measures for resolved referrals</strong> - By referral type, shows the number of measures recorded for resolved referrals. The report breaks the counts down by 'Treatment Completed' and 'Other conclusion'. Within this breakdown the counts are futher broken down by resolved referrals with no measures, resolved referrals with only an initial or final measure and resolved referrals with both an initial and final measure.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage of Standard Measures</strong> - By referral type, shows the percentage of measures used that were standard measures. The report breaks these percentages down by initial collection, final collection and total.</p>

    <h4>February 26, 2016</h4>
	<p>One of the key features of the Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MHSRRA programme is flexibility in the delivery of services and the engagement of allied and nursing mental health professionals. In recognition of the difficulties experienced in some locations in readily accessing a medical practitioner, some flexibility in the timing of a medical practitioner's involvement may be considered in order for the client to commence to receive services while arrangements are made for the client to see a GP.</p>
<p>However, all clients receiving services under the MHSRRA programme MUST obtain and have ongoing clinical oversight from a medical practitioner.</p>
<p>It is expected that data would be entered into the MDS once a referral has been obtained from a GP.</p>

    <h4>January 27, 2016</h4>
	<p>The Department expects that all organisations providing MHSRRA services should be entering data from 1 January 2016. The Department doesn¹t expect organisations to back date data before 1 January 2016, however, if organisations hold the information and have capacity to enter the data, it would be advised that they enter data from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015.</p>
<p>Referrals received before 1 January 2016 (or 1 July 2015 for those who have the capacity) should be included in the reported data only if sessions were delivered after 1 January 2016 (or 1 July 2015 for those who have the capacity).</p>
<p>For non-PHNs only:<br />The Department understands that the four non-PHN organisations may not be collecting data at the same level as PHNs. These organisations are not expected to establish new data collection systems for the remainder of 2015-16. They are however, expected to enter what data they are already collecting.</p>

	<p>MDS Update v4.190 was released on December 16th, 2015.</p>
<p>The ATAPS MDS can now be used to capture Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) data.</p>
<p>It has been determined that ATAPS and MHSRRA will have largely congruent data capture requirements in the future. Although MHSRRA is not part of the ATAPS program, for convenience, a new referral type 'MHSRRA' has been added. Documentation is available at <a href="../../technical-documentation/uploading-mhsrra-data/index.html" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/uploading-mhsrra-data/</a> summarising the changes to the upload file formats required in order to include MHSRRA data.

    <h4>December 01, 2015</h4>
	<p>Please find below a communication from the Department of Health and Strategic Data, who with the University of Melbourne, manage the reporting requirements for the Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) programme on behalf of the Department of Health.</p>
<h2>ATAPS Data Inequity</h2>
<p>From 1 July 2015, 31 Primary Health Networks (PHNs) replaced 61 Medicare Local geographical regions. While the specific methods of local data collection are the purview of the networks themselves, we would like to emphasise the importance of maintaining existing Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS)-Minimum Data Set (MDS) data integrity following the transition process to PHNs. PHNs have entered into a contractual agreement with the Department of Health to provide a set number of sessions to an individual within a twelve month period. These limits are based on programme type and are defined in the ATAPS operational guidelines. This means that PHNs are responsible for identifying individuals and tracking them centrally in order to ensure that patients are not receiving sessions from more than one provider.</p>
<p>There should only be a single identifier for a patient or provider within a PHN. This allows patients and providers moving within the sub-regions of a PHN to be identified as the same (de-identified) person within the MDS and your own datasets. Planned improvements to reporting within the MDS include figures derived from the number of unique clients seen. Any clients with more than one identifier will reduce the accuracy of the data collection.</p>
<p>In view of the commissioning role of PHNs and the size of their catchment areas, some PHNs are subcontracting service delivery to other organisations. These organisations are allowed to manage their own data independently, including patient identifiers. In order to achieve this, PHNs are partitioning their patient identifiers across their sub-regions, and not centrally managing patient information. Not consolidating identifying information within the PHN has unintended results. For example, a patient could receive treatment from multiple providers, thus receive more than the maximum number of sessions the programme permits within a twelve month period.</p>
<h3><a></a>Expectations</h3>
<p>Where service delivery has been commissioned/subcontracted to other organisations, it remains the PHN's responsibility to ensure that there is a single identifier for a patient or provider within the PHN.  Furthermore, it remains the PHN's responsibility to ensure that the identifiers are unique and are not duplicated between contracted service providers.</p>
<h3><a></a>Assistance and advice</h3>
<p>Some providers of client management software are aware of the problem the PHNs have in centrally tracking patients and are looking at implementing solutions. Please contact your local software provider to see if they can assist you.</p>
<p>PHNs are encouraged to share examples of best practice. In order to facilitate this a <a href="../../user-documentation/assignment-and-management-of-client-and-provider-identifiers/index.html">website</a> has been set up where examples of best practice can be shared. If your PHN is currently centrally managing identifiers, it would be appreciated if you could email the ATAPS MDS support team (by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>) describing how your organisation manages identifiers so that your experience can be shared with other PHNs.</p>
<p>We are also aware that some PHNs are centrally managing their patient and provider information but are still partitioning their identifiers in order to manage the volume. While there are no set protocols, we would strongly discourage encoding region information within an identifier as region information can and has changed. A method by which referrals can be tagged is currently being implemented. This will give PHNs a method to partition their data without encoding information into the patient identifier. PHNs will be advised when this feature is available.</p>
<p>If required, identifiers for patients and providers can be bulk recoded within the MDS. Any PHN that requires recoding their client and/or provider identifiers can contact the ATAPS MDS support team (by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>) to discuss options and implications in more detail.</p>

	<p>MDS Update v4.175 has been released.</p>
<p>The following new features will be available</p>
<ul>
<li>A new conclusion "Patient ineligible" was added. This conclusion may only be selected if there are NO sessions associated with the referral.

    <h4>March 24, 2015</h4>
	<h2>Importance of persistent client and provider identifiers</h2>
<p>A number of requests for assistance have been raised regarding protocols when upgrading and/or moving Medicare Local’s databases to new systems.</p>
<p>While there are no set protocols we would like to emphasise the importance of maintaining existing ATAPS-MDS data integrity during the transfer process. In particular, you must ensure that relevant identifiers for ‘patient_key’, ‘mhpro’ and ‘referrer_code’ are maintained so that historical analysis of the dataset is not compromised. So, for example, the same person in your new system should have the same code as they had in the old system. If it is not possible to use the existing codes then a mapping between the old and new codes should be provided so that the historical data can be updated on your behalf by the ATAPS-MDS support team.</p>
<h2>Recording of ineligible patients at triage stage</h2>
<p>New patients and/or referrals that are deemed ineligible for ATAPS services at the triage stage are generally considered out of scope of the MDS and should therefore not be recorded in the ATAPS-MDS.</p>
<p>It has been brought to our attention that the conclusion “referred elsewhere” is sometimes being incorrectly used to designate referrals that either never resulted in sessions and/or which were originally deemed to be ineligible for ATAPS services. However, this code is purely intended to be used for referrals where sessions have already begun to be delivered but where the patient has been referred to another location, if they moved for example.</p>
<p>Ideally, these out of scope referrals should therefore be removed from the MDS, however this may prove onerous as there is no automatic way of deleting referrals. As an alternative, we will be adding a new conclusion: “patient ineligible”. Once we have done so, it would be greatly appreciated if existing instances of referrals incorrectly using “referred elsewhere” as their conclusion be updated to the conclusion “patient ineligible”. We will notify you when the new conclusion has been added, at this stage we anticipate early April.</p>

	<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>We are seeking to improve the quality of ATAPS data and have therefore identified several areas where file upload checks can be improved. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Children referral type is only allowed for persons 15 years or younger. Errors will be generated when trying to add a Children type referral for a person 16 years or older.</li>
<li>The Paediatrician referrer type is only allowed for persons 15 years or younger. Errors will be generated when trying to add a Paediatrician referrer type for a person 16 years or older.</li>
</ul>
<p>These checks will commence as of 19 August and will apply to all referrals.</p>
<p>The data specifications are outlined on the Upload File Format documentation for referrals: <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html#referrals-upload-format" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/file-format/#referrals-upload-format</a></p>

    <h4>May 23, 2014</h4>
	<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>This is a reminder that the Copayment field is to become mandatory in the ATAPS MDS from the 1st of June, 2014. This will only apply to sessions dated after the 1st of June, 2014. The copayment field will still be optional for sessions dated before the 1st of June, 2014.

    <h4>April 09, 2014</h4>
	<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>Last week a message was issued to Medicare Local CEO's from the Department of Health advising that the Copayment field is to become mandatory in the ATAPS MDS from the 1st of June, 2014. This will only apply to sessions dated after the 1st of June, 2014. The copayment field will still be optional for sessions dated before the 1st of June, 2014. This change means that if no copayment was charged, $0 will need to be entered into the copayment field.</p>
<p>This change is needed to address a significant percentage of MDS entries that do not complete this data field. It is important that the Department has information on the proportion of ATAPS services charging a copayment and the level of that copayment per individual service.</p>

    <div id="/mds/announcements/2013-11-06-Mental-Health-Workforce-Data/"><h3>Mental Health Workforce Data</h3></div>
    <h4>November 06, 2013</h4>
	<p>The Department of Health and Ageing has asked the ATAPS evaluation team to include data about the ATAPS mental health workforce on the MDS. The purpose of maintaining MHPro data on the MDS is so that the ATAPS Mental Health Professional workforce can be reported on at regular intervals and any changes to the composition of the workforce can be observed. In the past two years the reporting of health workforce data has been increasing, and it is important that ATAPS also has the potential to showcase the distribution, diversity and quality of its workforce.</p>
<p>Two options for collecting this information are outlined in the next section.</p>
<p>In 2010 a survey was designed to capture demographic and professional information about the Mental Health Professionals (MHPros) delivering ATAPS services with the intention of this information becoming an ongoing feature of the MDS. Given the pressures of migrating the MDS from the former Divisions of General Practice to the current Medicare Locals structure, activating the Mental Health Professional data collection functionality on the MDS was put on hold. However, we are now in a position for this information to be captured. Therefore ATAPS project officers need to target the active MHPros in their Medicare Local to complete some professional information for inclusion in the MDS. ‘Active MHPro’ means any MHPro who has provided ATAPS services in the past 12 months. When additional MHPros are engaged to provide ATAPS, their professional and sociodemographic data also needs to be collected and entered into the MDS.</p>
<p>There are 12 fields of data to be completed for each MHPro and this should take no more than five minutes per MHPro.</p>
<h2>Updating Mental Health Workforce Data </h2>
<p>There are 2 options for completing the Mental Health Workforce Data; your choice of option may be dependent on the number of MHPros working within your Medicare Local. <strong>Option 1, </strong>where data is entered directly into the Minimum Dataset by Medicare Local staff, may be most useful for those Medicare Locals with only a few providers, whereas <strong>Option 2,</strong> where the individual Mental Health Professional enters their own details, may be more appropriate for Medicare Locals with a large number of providers. </p>
<p>More information on Option 1 is available at <a href="option-1/index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/announcements/2013-10-30/option-1/</a></p>
<p>More information on Option 2 is available at <a href="option-2/index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/announcements/2013-10-30/option-2/</a></p>
<p>All Mental Health Professional Data for active MHPros should be completed on the MDS by the close of business on <strong>Friday 22</strong><strong>nd</strong><strong> of November 2013.</strong> </p>

    <h4>April 10, 2013</h4>
	<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) Minimum Dataset upgrades and additional information</p>
<h2>Introduction of mandatory <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>, postcode and ‘no show’ fields in the MDS</h2>
<p>On the 1 June 2013 the Statistical Linkage Key (<a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>), the GP and patient postcode fields and the 'no show' field will be made mandatory in the Minimum Dataset.</p>
<p>The purpose of the SLK is to maintain greater accuracy of patient data, within and across Medicare Locals (MLs). The SLK provides the capacity to estimate the proportion of repeat clients across time in order to support more accurate reporting of repeat vs new clients being serviced. This capacity also helps managers to allocate resources according to program requirements (e.g. limits to the maximum number of sessions per client per 12 month period).</p>
<p>A number of MLs have expressed concerns around privacy issues and the SLK. One concern is that ATAPS Mental Health Professionals would need to supply name and date of birth information to the ML in order to generate the SLK. In order to solve this, an SLK generator is now available at:</p>
<p><a href="https://ataps-mds.net/slk">https://ataps-mds.net/slk</a></p>
<p>ATAPS Mental Health Professionals can use this to generate an SLK for inclusion in materials sent to the ML instead of providing personal details.</p>
<p>Another concern was that the SLK includes enough of a person's details (parts of their name, their gender, and date of birth) that they may still be identifiable. In order to alleviate this, the SLK can be provided, and is always stored, as a meaningless looking string of characters via a 'hashing' algorithm similar to those used by secure computer systems to protect user passwords. This hashed SLK can then be compared in the same way the non-hashed SLK can.</p>
<p>Further information about SLKs, including how to generate them, can be found in the <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Postcodes are to become mandatory in order to derive a measure of 'remoteness' for each referral. This measure will help evaluators and funders of the program better understand how remoteness impacts access to services.</p>
<p>The 'no show' field is to become mandatory as it contributes to efficiency-related reporting.</p>
<h2>Further information on the MDS</h2>
<p>At the recent ATAPS Child Mental Health Workshop, a number of issues were raised relating to the MDS. Some of these were general concerns and some were specific problems encountered in working with the MDS. We hope that the information below will update you on the resolution of some of these issues. Strategic Data, who are responsible for administering the MDS, are working to make the changes necessary to maintain pace with changes to the ATAPS program.</p>
<p>Entering more than one session for the same patient on the same day</p>
<p>1. Issue raised: The MDS does not allow more than one session to be entered for an individual patient for a single day. This is problematic for the Suicide Prevention program in particular.</p>
<p>Currently the MDS will not allow users to upload data on more than one session for the same patient on the same day. This issue only affects users who upload their data, not those who enter it manually. Those who enter data manually are able to enter more than session per patient per day.</p>
<p>A permanent solution to this problem is being sought by Strategic Data.</p>
<p>However, for those who upload the data, rather than enter it manually, there is one way to work around this problem until a permanent solution can be found:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload the first of the patient’s sessions for the day in question</li>
<li>then manually enter the subsequent sessions for the same patient, same day, using the online interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this will take a little longer, it is one way to ensure the data is entered correctly while we work on another solution.</p>
<h2>Data options for Child Mental Health Services</h2>
<p>2. Issue raised: Some of the data options in the MDS do not match the Operational Guidelines for the provision of ATAPS Child Mental Health Services.</p>
<p>Changes to the MDS related to the CMHS are being altered as a matter of priority. The new data options will be aligned with the CMHS guidelines and are being worked on now.</p>
<h2>Extreme Climatic Events</h2>
<p>3. Issue raised: There were some questions raised about not having access to an appropriate referral type for ATAPS services data where sessions have been provided to people experiencing severe climatic events.</p>
<p>Historically, only Medicare Locals who have received funding to provide ATAPS services to people affected by extreme climatic events had access to the 'Extreme Climatic Events' Referral type in the MDS.</p>
<p>An alteration to the 'Extreme Climatic Events'(ECE) Referral Type in the MDS will soon occur. This change will mean that all Medicare Locals will see the Referral Type options ‘Tier 2 ECE Flood/Cyclone’, ‘Tier 2 ECE Bushfire’, and ‘Tier 2 ECE Other’. While these referral types will be accessible to all Medicare Locals, they should only be used by those who have received specific funding for provision of services related to these Extreme Climatic Events.</p>
<p>This is one of several MDS issues that will be solved by a May 2013 deadline.</p>
<h2>Entering data from most used referrers and AHPros</h2>
<p>4. Issue raised: Previously there had been an issue with having to scroll down a list of all referrers and AHPros ever entered into the MDS for your Division/Medicare Local to find those that you use most commonly.</p>
<p>This issue was fixed at the end of last year. The input for referrers and AHPros for sessions is a now a "combobox" that allows both text input with autocomplete and a standard dropdown functionality.</p>
<p>Data entry users can type the first two or three characters of the referrer nickname and then select from a short list of referrers matching those characters OR Type the whole referrer nickname OR Use the list of all referrers in the organisation (which is often long).</p>
<p>As well as being able to locate referrers and AHPros more quickly, this also alerts users to any similar codes, in the case where typos or duplication of codes is being attempted in error.</p>
<h2>MDS reporting to Department of Health and Ageing</h2>
<p>5. Issue raised: MDS reporting</p>
<p>Strategic Data are also working on creating an option for Medicare Locals to be able to extract the MDS data they need for reporting to the Department using a standard function from the MDS. This will reduce the amount of work needed in regular reporting.</p>
<p>We will continue to work to update you on the various upgrades to the MDS that are currently being worked on and that will become active in the coming months.</p>
<p>If you are having some difficulty with using the MDS, Strategic Data Ltd maintain the https://ataps-mds.com/ website, which has an extensive <a href="../../user-documentation/faq/index.html">FAQ’s section</a>. This is a live document and is therefore consistently updated.</p>

    <h4>July 13, 2011</h4>
	<p>For divisions who upload their data, please refer to the 'File Transfer/Upload' notes on the <a href="../../help/file-transfers/index.html#Uploads"> MDS Online Help</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="DIY_Password_recovery"></a> DIY Password recovery</h3>
<p>This allows users who have forgotten their password or username to recover either of these by entering either the registered email address or their Username. The system will issue a new password to the email address that is the authorised user for your ID account.</p>
<h3><a id="Detect_trailing_whitespace_in_uploads"></a> Detect trailing whitespace in uploads</h3>
<p>When uploading your data to the MDS, it necessary to include the exact data that the system accepts. If the system detects spaces after the data, the system will generate an error message and your upload will fail. This has been a widespread issue and the MDS now produces a meaningful error message so that you are able to pinpoint any errors if detected within your dataset.</p>
<h3><a id="Reduction_of_minimum_patient_key_length_from_3_to_2_characters"></a> Reduction of minimum patient key length from 3 to 2 characters</h3>
<p>The MDS now requires new Patient Key codes to be a minimum of 2 characters in length.</p>
<h3><a id="Ability_to_self_manage_40add_47edit_41_new_users_for_your_division"></a> Ability to self manage (add/edit) new users for your division</h3>
<p>Each MDS User account is assigned a specific <em>role</em>. The main authorised MDS users for each division have been assigned a <em>division</em> role. In the new 4.1 version of the MDS, <em>division</em> users can now add and edit new users for their division. More information is available on the <a href="../../help/user-management/index.html">MDS Online Help</a></p>
<h3><a id="Accessing_a_list_of_users_for_your_division"></a> Accessing a list of users for your division</h3>
<p>You can now access a list of all MDS users for your division. More information is available on the <a href="../../help/user-management/index.html#View_List_of_all_users_40for_your_ml_41">MDS Online Help</a></p>
