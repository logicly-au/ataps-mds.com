				<title>NOTIFICATION of the Shutdown of the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;NOTIFICATION of the Shutdown of the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS will be shut down on Monday 6 August 2018.&lt;/em&gt;  After 6 August 2018 all data must be entered into the PMHC MDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS has been kept online to allow existing client referrals received prior to 1 July 2017 under the old ATAPS/MHSRRA system to be maintained until all sessions associated with that referral were complete. As of 1 July 2017 only new sessions for these existing clients were to be entered into the old ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS. No new clients or referrals were to be entered into the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All referrals entered into the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS prior to 1 July 2017 are expected to have completed their ATAPS/MHSRRA sessions by 30 June 2018 and have their data entered into the ATAPS/MHRRSA MDS prior to the system being shut down on 6 August 2018. Should the client require continuing services beyond 30 June 2018, the service provider or PHN should make arrangements for the client to be reregistered through the PMHC MDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any new referrals made after 1 July 2017 should have been entered into the new Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@ataps-mds.com.&quot;&gt;support@ataps-mds.com&lt;/a&gt; with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>UPDATE regarding data collection expectations – ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS and the PMHC MDS</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Primary Health Networks (PHNs) are aware, work has commenced on the design of a Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS) and associated reporting arrangements.  This does not represent a ground up development but rather builds on the foundation established by the current ATAPS/MHSRRA minimum data set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Mental Health Schedule states:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Department will develop specifications for a PMHC MDS and establish arrangements for reporting of data by PHNs by December 2016, using as a foundation the previous data collection and reporting arrangements established for the ATAPS and MHSRRA programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Department will undertake this work in consultation with PHNs to ensure that all mandatory data are both relevant to monitoring achievement of the Key Objectives identified in Item B.3 subsection 1 of this Schedule and feasible for reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Organisation must ensure all mandatory data is reported to the PMHC MDS as specified by the Department and achieving full compliance with reporting by 30 June 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This schedule requirement has raised a number of questions from PHNs with some PHNs making preparations to change their client management systems to report on ‘First Level Data Items’ outlined in the data paper provided to them on 18 March 2016. This was an initial draft and further work is being undertaken in consultation with PHNs to finalise data items and definitions.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such it is important that PHNs hold off on making significant changes to their existing systems until the Department releases the agreed specifications for the new PMHC MDS. This is anticipated to take place in August 2016.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department’s expectations for PHNs with regard to data collection are set out below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Expectation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHNs maintain their existing ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS whilst the redesign process is underway given the expectation that the new data collection system will build on this existing dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHNs maintain any other existing data sets which are anticipated to impact on their future models of mental health activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHNs consider planning for their own future collections to inform the commissioning they anticipate undertaking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Collections:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will remain important for both PHNs and the Department to collect data on patient services to support future activity in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department will be working with PHNs and the University of Melbourne/Strategic Data to identify data reporting and monitoring needs for all the services provided through the PHN primary mental health care flexible funding pool and develop an appropriate data collection system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was discussed at the March PHN CEO Forum where a data paper was provided to PHNs, identifying how the MDS will be enhanced in the future to allow more flexibility for the transition of mental health activity into the PHN mental health flexible funding pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper invited PHNs to indicate interest and nominate representatives for a small reference group to oversee the redesign of the existing ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS to collect client information for all service streams under the flexible funding pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of PHNs have responded and the first meeting of the group is expected in mid to late June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process and timelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PMHC MDS will progress in stages, with initial priority to establish capacity to capture mental health nursing data previously maintained through the MHNIP session claim process administered by the Department of Human Services, along with other new service types that cannot be accommodated in the current ATAPS/MHSRRA system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is expected to be operational by October 2016 with release of an interim reporting system that will run alongside the current ATAPS/MHSRRA system. This will be followed by release in the first half of 2017 of the more comprehensive arrangement that brings together the ATAPS/MHSRRA data reporting with the new service type data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stage of development will aim to capture all client services commissioned by PHNs with the exception of those delivered through headspace centres which are covered by a specific collection managed by headspace national office. This will be considered in the second stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department appreciates that PHNs need to be aware of the specific data items they would need to report on to ensure that the commissioned services are collecting and reporting on such data items.  The Department is aiming to finalise the comprehensive specifications that define the required data by &lt;strong&gt;August 2016&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communications:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details will be distributed and shared through the necessary stakeholder groups as they become available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively should you have any immediate concerns or technical questions in regard to the collection of data for mental health please direct them to Strategic Data (responsible for the Minimum Data Set) at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@ataps-mds.com&quot;&gt;support@ataps-mds.com&lt;/a&gt; to discuss how to manage data entry during the interim period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you wish to provide input to the discussions you can do so by writing to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:PMHCSSInbox@health.gov.au&quot;&gt;PMHCSSInbox@health.gov.au&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Standard outcome measures</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;MDS Update v4.197 was released on May 27, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are many outcome measures available for use on the minimum dataset. Some of the measures are either inappropriate or not commonly used by providers. Pre and post treatment scores for a given consumer on less frequently used outcome measures are excluded in statistical analyses for the national evaluation. Further, there is poor completion of the existing outcome measures. This is particularly problematic since a measure pre and post treatment is required in order to analyse consumer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, outcome measures are being standardised in the MDS and outcome measure compliance reports have been added. The following measures will be standard in the MDS: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kessler 10 (K10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kessler 5 (K5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPNDS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modified Scaled for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other measures will be phased out over time. Organisations can select which measures they collect within the MDS, however once a non-standard measure has been disabled, organisations will no longer be able to turn it back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We acknowledge that there are good reasons why an outcome measure may not be able to be collected. In order to allow for this a Non Completion measure has been added. This measure can be selected in lieu of another measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help organisations improve their outcome measure completion and use of standard measures, three new reports have been added to the MDS. These are listed under 'Report selection &amp;gt; Performance Indicators'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days&lt;/strong&gt; - By referral type, shows the number of referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days and also the number of referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days as a percentage of referrals without a conclusion. These figures are shown for three time periods - End of previous finanical year, end of last quarter and today so that organisations can track their progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measures for resolved referrals&lt;/strong&gt; - By referral type, shows the number of measures recorded for resolved referrals. The report breaks the counts down by 'Treatment Completed' and 'Other conclusion'. Within this breakdown the counts are futher broken down by resolved referrals with no measures, resolved referrals with only an initial or final measure and resolved referrals with both an initial and final measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percentage of Standard Measures&lt;/strong&gt; - By referral type, shows the percentage of measures used that were standard measures. The report breaks these percentages down by initial collection, final collection and total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;../../help/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/user-guide/&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to reflect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>MHSRRA uploads to the ATAPS MDS</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MHSRRA programme is flexibility in the delivery of services and the engagement of allied and nursing mental health professionals. In recognition of the difficulties experienced in some locations in readily accessing a medical practitioner, some flexibility in the timing of a medical practitioner's involvement may be considered in order for the client to commence to receive services while arrangements are made for the client to see a GP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all clients receiving services under the MHSRRA programme MUST obtain and have ongoing clinical oversight from a medical practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that data would be entered into the MDS once a referral has been obtained from a GP.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>MHSRRA uploads to the ATAPS MDS</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The Department expects that all organisations providing MHSRRA services should be entering data from 1 January 2016. The Department doesn¹t expect organisations to back date data before 1 January 2016, however, if organisations hold the information and have capacity to enter the data, it would be advised that they enter data from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referrals received before 1 January 2016 (or 1 July 2015 for those who have the capacity) should be included in the reported data only if sessions were delivered after 1 January 2016 (or 1 July 2015 for those who have the capacity).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-PHNs only:&lt;br /&gt;The Department understands that the four non-PHN organisations may not be collecting data at the same level as PHNs. These organisations are not expected to establish new data collection systems for the remainder of 2015-16. They are however, expected to enter what data they are already collecting.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Update to the ATAPS minimum dataset - January 2016</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;MDS Update v4.193 was released on January 21, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Level matrix reports are now available under the 'Report selection' page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two Service Level matrix reports intended for use by organisations in their departmental reporting. One report summarises activity by counting attended sessions; the other indicates the number of patients in receipt of sessions delivered by service providers funded/commissioned by the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service Level matrix reports can be used to generate the reports required by The Department of Health for KPI 3.2a/b and c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;../../user-documentation/user-guide/reports/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/user-guide/reports/&lt;/a&gt; has been updated to reflect theses changes.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>MHSRRA Updates to the ATAPS minimum dataset - December 2015</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;MDS Update v4.190 was released on December 16th, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATAPS MDS can now be used to capture Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been determined that ATAPS and MHSRRA will have largely congruent data capture requirements in the future. Although MHSRRA is not part of the ATAPS program, for convenience, a new referral type 'MHSRRA' has been added. Documentation is available at &lt;a href=&quot;../../technical-documentation/uploading-mhsrra-data/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/uploading-mhsrra-data/&lt;/a&gt; summarising the changes to the upload file formats required in order to include MHSRRA data. The documentation at &lt;a href=&quot;../../technical-documentation/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/&lt;/a&gt; has been also been updated to reflect these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHNs who collect MHSRRA data have automatically had this new referral type enabled. If your PHN collects MHSRRA data and you do not have access to this referral type please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@ataps-mds.com.&quot;&gt;support@ataps-mds.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about capturing or uploading MHSRRA data please contact &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@ataps-mds.com.&quot;&gt;support@ataps-mds.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Assignment and management of client and provider identifiers for ATAPS data collection</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Please find below a communication from the Department of Health and Strategic Data, who with the University of Melbourne, manage the reporting requirements for the Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) programme on behalf of the Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ATAPS Data Inequity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1 July 2015, 31 Primary Health Networks (PHNs) replaced 61 Medicare Local geographical regions. While the specific methods of local data collection are the purview of the networks themselves, we would like to emphasise the importance of maintaining existing Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS)-Minimum Data Set (MDS) data integrity following the transition process to PHNs. PHNs have entered into a contractual agreement with the Department of Health to provide a set number of sessions to an individual within a twelve month period. These limits are based on programme type and are defined in the ATAPS operational guidelines. This means that PHNs are responsible for identifying individuals and tracking them centrally in order to ensure that patients are not receiving sessions from more than one provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should only be a single identifier for a patient or provider within a PHN. This allows patients and providers moving within the sub-regions of a PHN to be identified as the same (de-identified) person within the MDS and your own datasets. Planned improvements to reporting within the MDS include figures derived from the number of unique clients seen. Any clients with more than one identifier will reduce the accuracy of the data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In view of the commissioning role of PHNs and the size of their catchment areas, some PHNs are subcontracting service delivery to other organisations. These organisations are allowed to manage their own data independently, including patient identifiers. In order to achieve this, PHNs are partitioning their patient identifiers across their sub-regions, and not centrally managing patient information. Not consolidating identifying information within the PHN has unintended results. For example, a patient could receive treatment from multiple providers, thus receive more than the maximum number of sessions the programme permits within a twelve month period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where service delivery has been commissioned/subcontracted to other organisations, it remains the PHN's responsibility to ensure that there is a single identifier for a patient or provider within the PHN.  Furthermore, it remains the PHN's responsibility to ensure that the identifiers are unique and are not duplicated between contracted service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Assistance and advice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some providers of client management software are aware of the problem the PHNs have in centrally tracking patients and are looking at implementing solutions. Please contact your local software provider to see if they can assist you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHNs are encouraged to share examples of best practice. In order to facilitate this a &lt;a href=&quot;../../user-documentation/assignment-and-management-of-client-and-provider-identifiers/index.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has been set up where examples of best practice can be shared. If your PHN is currently centrally managing identifiers, it would be appreciated if you could email the ATAPS MDS support team (by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@ataps-mds.com&quot;&gt;support@ataps-mds.com&lt;/a&gt;) describing how your organisation manages identifiers so that your experience can be shared with other PHNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also aware that some PHNs are centrally managing their patient and provider information but are still partitioning their identifiers in order to manage the volume. While there are no set protocols, we would strongly discourage encoding region information within an identifier as region information can and has changed. A method by which referrals can be tagged is currently being implemented. This will give PHNs a method to partition their data without encoding information into the patient identifier. PHNs will be advised when this feature is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If required, identifiers for patients and providers can be bulk recoded within the MDS. Any PHN that requires recoding their client and/or provider identifiers can contact the ATAPS MDS support team (by sending an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:support@ataps-mds.com&quot;&gt;support@ataps-mds.com&lt;/a&gt;) to discuss options and implications in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>MDS Update</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;MDS Update v4.186 has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following changes were implemented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of the transition from Medicare Locals to Primary Health Networks, any users that log in but only have permissions to access a disabled organisation (eg, a Medicare Local) will be show an &lt;strong&gt;Insufficient access rights&lt;/strong&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If  you are seeing this page and your data has been transitioned, please either&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contact your primary contact for the ATAPS MDS for your organisation, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the ATAPS MDS support team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for further assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
