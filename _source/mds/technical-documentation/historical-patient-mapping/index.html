    <h1>Historical patient mapping</h1>
<p>In the minimum dataset, when patients were migrated from a Division of General Practice into a Medicare Local, we added extra data to map the patient to the Medicare Local and flagged that the patient was active within the Medicare Local. We then flagged that the patient was inactive with the Division of General Practice. This allowed us to maintain a history of the organisations with which the patient had been active.</p>
<p>Using the Division redistribution data as confirmed by the Medicare Locals along with the active status on the patient organisation mapping, we can calculate the proportions of patients that were migrated from a Division of General Practice into the various Medicare Locals specified by the redistribution.</p>
<p>This is done by counting the number of patients that are inactive in the Divisions of General Practice and that are active in the redistributed Medicare Locals.</p>
<p>As an example; assume a Division of General Practice had 1000 patients; it was split into three Medicare Locals,</p>
<ul>
<li>600 patients into ML1,</li>
<li>100 into ML2 and</li>
<li>50 into ML3,</li>
</ul>
<p>leaving 250 historical patients in the Division of General Practice.</p>
<p>The proportion of those historical patients to be (nominally) associated with ML1 is 600/(600+100+50) = 0.8, or 200 patients.</p>
<p>Active patients in historical Divisions are then deterministically allocated to each Medicare Local so that there is no randomness involved.</p>
