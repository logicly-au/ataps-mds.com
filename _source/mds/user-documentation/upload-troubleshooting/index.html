    <h1>Upload Troubleshooting : Common Errors when Uploading Data</h1>
<ul id="toc"></ul>
<p>This page provides some common error messages that the MDS renders when users encounter uploading problems. To help decipher these this page provides basic explanations and solutions to try to overcome these issues.</p>
<h2><a id="Not_allowed_to_update_division:_NAME_OF_DIVISION"></a> Not allowed to update division: NAME OF DIVISION</h2>
<p>The user ID you are using does not have permission to upload data. Contact a "Division" level user in your PHN or the Help Desk ( <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>) and request that the upload feature is enabled for your user ID.</p>
<h2><a id="Unknown_Patient"></a> Unknown Patient</h2>
<p>If you are trying to upload a referral or session record and received this error message, it means that the associated patient key code listed in your upload file is not known (i.e., the patient record containing that patient key code has not yet been uploaded). If you think it has been uploaded, check for spelling or data errors either in the patient record or the file that you are currently uploading to ensure accuracy.</p>
<h2><a id="Duplicate_session_for_referral"></a> Duplicate session for referral</h2>
<p>This suggests that you are trying to upload session data that already exists in the MDS. The system will not allow duplicate session data to be uploaded, so you should only upload new session records.</p>
<h2><a id="Cannot_locate_referral_for_patient"></a> Cannot locate referral for patient</h2>
<p>This error indicates that the referral record has not yet been entered. For session data to upload successfully you need to have all associated 'patient' and 'referral' data uploaded first, or concurrently.</p>
<h2><a id="Invalid_header_45_missing_column"></a> Invalid header - missing column</h2>
<p>This error message indicates that a required column in your data file is missing. Check the required columns/data in the MDS Online Help under <a href="../../help/file-transfers/index.html#Uploads">File Transfers / Uploads</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="Incorrect_number_of_fields_405_41._Check_trailing_commas_63"></a> Incorrect number of fields (5). Check trailing commas?</h2>
<p>If you receive errors regarding having the incorrect number of columns on some rows of your file, then this is usually caused by your export method adding or subtracting blank columns.</p>
<p>Even if there are no values recorded in the final few columns of the row, there must still be the correct number of columns (and thus commas), matching the header row. Some people have had trouble with their application's export process stripping blank columns off.</p>
<p>Some applications have gone the other way, and added extra blank columns to some rows.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that the file(s) you export from other third party databases (e.g., Mhagic, Chilli DB?, etc.,) are not edited or changed prior to uploading to the MDS.</p>
<h2><a id="Trailing_white_45space"></a> Trailing white-space</h2>
<p>When putting textual values into cells that must match a specific reference, please note that although the case (capitalisation, or lack thereof) is not important, you must avoid leaving trailing or leading white-space (ie. spaces, tabs, etc). If you're seeing this error come up, have a look at the rows in question, and you will find that one or more cell will look like "this " or " this " rather than "this".</p>
