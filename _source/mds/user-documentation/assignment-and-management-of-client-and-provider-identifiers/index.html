    <h1>Assignment and management of client and provider identifiers</h1>
<p>There should only be a single identifier for a patient or provider within a PHN. This allows patients and providers moving within the sub-regions of a PHN to be identified as the same (de-identified) person within the MDS and your own datasets. Where service delivery has been subcontracted to other organisations, it remains the PHN's responsibility to ensure identifiers are unique and do not clash between contracted service providers. Furthermore, it remains the PHN's responsibility to ensure that there is a single identifier for a patient or provider within the PHN.</p>
<p>This page will be used to highlight examples of best practice that can be used to help PHNs manage their identifiers.</p>
<p>If your PHN is currently centrally managing identifiers, it would be appreciated if you could email the ATAPS MDS support team (by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>) describing how you manage identifiers so that your experience can be shared with other PHNs.</p>
