    <h1>Collection of MHSRRA data</h1>
<p>Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) is a program that provides funding for more allied and nursing mental health services in rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>It has been determined that ATAPS and MHSRRA will have largely congruent data capture requirements in the future. Although MHSRRA is not part of the ATAPS program, for convenience, a new referral type 'MHSRRA' has been incorporated into the ATAPS MDS.</p>
<p>MHSRRA data can be entered via the ATAPS MDS website at <a href="https://ataps-mds.net/">https://ataps-mds.net/</a>. Data can either be entered manually or via bulk upload. Instructions for bulk upload can be found atÂ <a href="../../technical-documentation/uploading-mhsrra-data/index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/uploading-mhsrra-data/</a>.</p>
<p>Primary Health Networks (PHNs) who collect MHSRRA data have automatically had this new referral type enabled. If your PHN collects MHSRRA data and you do not have access to this referral type please contact support@ataps-mds.com.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about capturing or uploading MHSRRA data please contact support@ataps-mds.com.</p>
