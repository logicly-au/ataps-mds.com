    <h1>Upload Checklist</h1>
<p>This page is intended to provide a brief overview of the key processes and requirements for uploading data in bulk to the MDS. For detailed information please refer to the references at the bottom of this page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure your User ID (username) has been enabled to upload data. (Users in your PHN with "Division" access can enable data upload or Email the Help Desk? <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> to request that your username is enabled to upload data to the MDS.)</li>
<li>Prepare 3 data files for uploading: ‘Patients’, ‘Referrals’ and ‘Sessions’. Each file should contain all the column headings and data types as per table listed in the <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html">Upload File Format</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure the file(s) you are uploading are in .csv format.</li>
<li>Avoid over-handling your data files and ensure accuracy. The MDS requires extreme precision, therefore if there are spaces, commas, tabs or other unacceptable characters within your data file(s), the upload is likely to fail.</li>
<li>Until you become more experienced with the upload process, it is advisable to upload one file at a time.</li>
<li>Upload in sequential order: 1. Patient 2. Referrals and then 3. Sessions. The ‘Referrals’ file relies on the associated ‘Patient’ data to be in the MDS for it to upload successfully. If not, you will receive an error message indicating ‘missing patient’. Likewise, the ‘Session’ file will depend on associated ‘Referrals’ and ‘Patient’ data to be in the MDS for it to upload successfully.</li>
<li>Always attempt your upload in 'test only' mode first by clicking the checkbox prior to uploading. If your test upload returned an 'upload successful' message, then uncheck the 'test only' box and proceed to upload again. NOTE: Data uploaded in 'test only' mode will not be saved.</li>
<li>We recommend you upload in a regular and systematic way. Keeping a regular uploading process in place will overcome some problems in terms of encountering duplicate data. For example, if you don’t keep track of what data you have already uploaded and try to upload the same data, the MDS will produce an error message. You can overcome this with patient and referral data by clicking on the ‘replace duplicates’ box; however, this option is not available for sessions data.</li>
<li>It is up to you when or how often you upload your data, however, it is expected that data does not lag more than one month behind the current month. The Evaluation Team and / or Do HA? will download data at any given time throughout the year to obtain or report on data, therefore it is important to maintain currency.</li>
<li>Always keep track of when and what you upload to the MDS and always check your data by using the ‘download’ feature to ensure your data in the MDS is as you expect it to be.</li>
<li>Error messages. To help you understand and deal with errors in your upload, we have listed some of the most common error messages encountered and provide an explanation and solution to these in the <a href="../upload-troubleshooting/index.html">Upload Troubleshooting guide.</a></li>
<li>If you encounter problems with uploading your data and require assistance, contact the Help Desk for support via email ( <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>). Screenshot the error message or copy the exact error message and paste it into your email to support.</li>
<li><strong>HINT:</strong> <a href="../faq/index.html#How_do_I_download_data_from_the_MDS_63">Download your MDS data</a> (using the File Transfers/Download feature of the MDS) to obtain an export of the data that is already in the MDS for your organisation (PHN). You can use these files as templates for uploading your data as the downloaded files are in the exact format/layout required for uploading your data. More information on this is available on the <a href="../faq/index.html">FAQS</a>.</li>
