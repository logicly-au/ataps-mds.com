    <h1>Transition of MLs to PHNs</h1>
<h2><strong>Trans<strong>ition of the ATAPS minimum dataset to include Primary Health Networks</strong></strong></h2>
<p>The University of Melbourne’s Centre for Mental Health (CMH) has been evaluating the ATAPS program (and its sub-programs) since its introduction. Part of their role includes the development and dissemination of a minimum dataset (MDS). The minimum dataset is designed to capture de-identified consumer-level information, which is invaluable for describing who is accessing allied health care as a result of these projects, as well as for providing a broad overview of the care these people are receiving.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all 31 Primary Health Networks will become new organisations registered with the MDS system. To reach this goal the Evaluation Team and Strategic Data have proposed a process to maintain the minimum dataset’s integrity through the transition from Medicare Locals to Primary Health Networks. The data required for the MDS will remain largely the same, notwithstanding minor changes that occur when changes to programs are made which require new data to be captured. The MDS system will be made ready for the transition by the start of July 2015.</p>
<h3><strong>How will the transition work?</strong></h3>
<p>The migration process for each <strong>Primary Health Network</strong> will proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> Where necessary, Strategic Data will request a Letter of Authority for the person in each Primary Health Network responsible for migrating and ongoing management of the data. Once this has been received, an account on the MDS will be created specifically for this person. This account will be set up with permissions to create other accounts for the Primary Health Network.</li>
<li>At the same time, Strategic Data will also confirm which Medicare Locals amalgamated to create each Primary Health Network. <strong>The University of Melbourne and Strategic Data will begin sending these e-mails the week of 22 June 2015.</strong> Once confirmed, historical data will be statistically mapped to the Primary Health Networks to enable access to relevant historical local data for forward planning purposes.</li>
<li>Once Steps 1 and 2 are completed, Strategic Data will provide Primary Health Networks with an online form listing all GPs (and other relevant referrers) from the amalgamating Medicare Locals, enabling them to select all those GPs and referrers that now work out of that Primary Health Network.</li>
<li>Once this data has been provided, Strategic Data will migrate all referrals for these GPs and referrers for the 12 months prior to amalgamation.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>What is expected of current Medicare Locals to facilitate the transition to Primary Health Networks?</strong></h3>
<p>As outlined by the Department of Health, it is important to maintain data integrity from Medicare Locals to Primary Health Networks. There are four important things that Medicare Locals can do to facilitate this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are encouraged to enter as much data into the MDS as you can by 30 Jun 2015 and enter the remainder as soon as possible afterwards.</li>
<li>Share with the relevant Primary Health Network client IDs and the list that allows clients to be matched to their ID for re-referral purposes.  This includes active clients as well as in-activ clients to enable future re-referrals to be identified and appropriately linked.</li>
<li>Share their lists of referrers and allied health professionals with the Primary Health Network in order to maintain the same ID for providers and referrers and avoid double counting of these professionals</li>
<li>Properly handover active clients to the relevant Primary Health Network responsible for their care under the ATAPS program (involving updating clients as appropriate if contact details are about to change, and ensuring relevant clinical and administrative information is transferred) to ensure the continuity of care<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Collection of MHSRRA data</strong></h3>
<p>If you are required to submit MHSRRA data, please inform Strategic Data via <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a></p>
<p>Strategic Data will then contact entities that are required to submit MHSRRA data separately, to provide further information regarding the process for submitting this data.</p>
<h3><strong>What will the Evaluation Team do?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Support Medicare Locals and Primary Health Networks through the transition</li>
<li>Provide training regarding the MDS and new functionality</li>
<li>Provide information to Medicare Locals and Primary Health Networks updating them of the progress of the transition</li>
</ul>
