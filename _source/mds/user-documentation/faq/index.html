<h3><a id="How_do_I_obtain_access_to_the_MDS_63" name="ObtainingAccess"></a> How do I obtain access to the MDS?</h3>
<p>Since the upgrade of the MDS to version 4.1 (on 13 July 2011), access to the MDS can be provided at two levels:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Access Level</th><th>Functionality provided</th><th>How to get an account with this level of access</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Division</td>
<td>A user with Division-level access has the ability to create accounts for other users within their Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation, and can manage the Outcome Measure tools settings. They can also maintain and upload data to the MDS.</td>
<td>This requires the traditional process of producing a <a href="index.html#LetterOfAuthority">Letter of Authority</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data entry</td>
<td>A user with data entry-level access has the ability to maintain and upload data to the MDS.</td>
<td>Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation personnel who wish to obtain this level of access should contact their organisation's main MDS user, who can create a user account for you.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4><a id="A_42Letter_of_Authority_42" name="LetterOfAuthority"></a> <strong>Letter of Authority</strong></h4>
<p>The protocol for setting up a new ID to access the MDS requires a written letter of authority. A <strong>letter of authority</strong> is a request made on your Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation's letterhead which must be signed by an authority at the Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation who holds a position that is higher than the person for whom the account is being created (i.e., the person's manager or the CEO).</p>
<p>This letter must contain the following details (for the person for whom the MDS access is being requested):</p>
<ol>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Contact telephone number</li>
<li>Mobile phone number</li>
<li>The exact Primary Health Network or Non-Government Health Organisation name in the MDS you are seeking access to</li>
<li>The level of access (Division or Data Entry) required for the user</li>
</ol>
<p>This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:</p>
<p>Strategic Data Fax: (03) 9340 9090 or Email: <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a></p>
<p>The same protocol applies if an MDS user no longer requires MDS access and needs to hand over their MDS access to another person. However, in this case it is advised that the new MDS user has a new username and password issued to protect the privacy and security of the organisation's data.</p>
<p>This process will also apply where a user is requesting a password re-set. However, the auto <a href="index.html#PasswordRecovery">password recovery</a> process available to you via the MDS login screen is the preferred method of password retrieval.</p>
<p>If your email address has changed, it is important that you update your account or notify your Division level user or the ATAPS helpdesk so that your records can be updated. When contacting the ATAPS helpdesk you will be asked to arrange for a letter of authority stating the change(s) and this must then be sent to Strategic Data via fax or scan/email. <a id="PasswordRecovery"></a></p>
<h3><a id="Password_or_Username_Recovery"></a> Password or username recovery</h3>
<p>Since the upgrade of the MDS to version 4.1 (on 13 July 2011), the system offers an <a href="https://ataps-mds.net/auth/password_reset">automated password/username recovery feature</a>. The system will email the registered email address on your account with your username and instructions on how to reset your password. (Therefore it is important to keep your email address current. Please contact your organisation's Divison level user or email the ATAPS helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> to update your email address on your MDS user account. Please note that a '<a href="index.html#LetterOfAuthority">Letter of Authority'</a> will need to be produced in order for the ATAPS helpdesk to reset your password, as email addresses are key identifiers for security.)</p>
<h3><a id="I_forgot_my_password._What_do_I_do_63"></a> I forgot my password. What do I do?</h3>
<p>Try using the <a href="https://ataps-mds.net/auth/password_reset">automated password/username recovery feature</a>. If you still cannot access your account, please contact your Primary Health Network Division level user who will be able to reset your password. If you are unsure who your Division level user is please email the ATAPS helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>. If you are a Division Level user, please email the ATAPS helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>. A <a href="index.html#LetterOfAuthority">'Letter of Authority'</a> requesting a password reset will need to be produced in order for the ATAPS helpdesk to reset your password.</p>
<h3><a id="How_do_I_get_started_using_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I get started using the MDS?</h3>
<p>Please refer to <a href="index.html#How_do_I_obtain_access_to_the_MDS_63">'How do I obtain access to the MDS?'</a> for information on getting an account on the MDS.</p>
<p>The MDS website is available at <a href="../../../index.html" target="_blank">https://ataps-mds.com</a>. Here you will find documentation on using the MDS.</p>
<p>The MDS is accessed on the web at the following address:<a href="https://ataps-mds.net" target="_blank">https://ataps-mds.net</a></p>
<h3><a id="Can_I_pass_on_my_username_and_password_to_the_Medicare_Local_39s_IT_person_or_evaluator_if_they_are_entering_data_63"></a> Can I pass on my username and password to the Primary Health Network's IT person or evaluator if they are entering data?</h3>
<p>No, each user should now be issued with their own username and password. Please have the user who has 'Division'-level access in your Primary Health Network create a separate account for the Primary Health Network's IT person or evaluator.</p>
<h3>Can GPs or Mental Health Providers (MHPs) access the MDS to enter data themselves?</h3>
<p>Yes, GPs and MHPs can access the MDS to enter their data directly into the system. However, it is not possible to limit their data entry access to the select data fields that they would normally manage. For example, MHPs would normally only need to enter or edit ‘session’ data in the MDS. However, it is not possible to restrict their access only to these fields. Therefore, MHPs who access the MDS could potentially change ‘client’ and ‘referral’ data as well.</p>
<h3><a id="test_mds_access"></a>I'm a third-party software developer developing software to assist with uploading data to the MDS. Can I have an account to test my data uploads?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can supply you with an account that has access to a test Primary Health Network. </p>
<p>In order to set up the test Primary Health Network account we need to follow a similar procedure to setting up a proper Primary Health Network account. To do that we require a Letter of Authority as detailed in the <a href="index.html#A_42Letter_of_Authority_42">Letter of Authority</a> section above.</p>
<p>Could you please provide a similar letter on your company's letterhead containing the following details:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the person the account is for</li>
<li>The email address of the person</li>
<li>Contact telephone number</li>
<li>Request access to the 'Test [Your Company Name]' Organisation</li>
</ol>
<p>This letter must be faxed or scanned then emailed to:</p>

<h2><a id="ENTERING_DATA_IN_THE_MINIMUM_DATASET_SYSTEM"></a> Entering data in the minimum dataset system</h2>
<h3><a id="GENERAL"></a> General</h3>
<h4><a id="How_often_should_I_enter_data_into_the_MDS_63"></a> How often should I enter data into the MDS?</h4>
<p>Ideally, data should be entered into the MDS as soon as it becomes available so that at any given time data can be downloaded nationally to provide an overall picture of service provision via the project. Data should be entered as frequently as is possible and reasonable but ideally should not lag by more than a month.</p>
<h4><a id="We_are_collecting_additional_data_44_such_as_a_patient_satisfaction_survey._Is_this_supposed_to_be_added_to_the_minimum_dataset_and_hence_be_given_to_the_Commonwealth_44_or_should_we_literally_only_report_the_minimum_data_63"></a> We are collecting additional data, such as a patient satisfaction survey. Is this supposed to be added to the minimum dataset and hence be given to the Commonwealth, or should we literally only report the minimum data?</h4>
<p>Data from the MDS will be used as the basis for periodic national evaluation reports, prepared by the national evaluation team for the Commonwealth. The additional data that you are collecting will go into your local evaluation report but does not need to be added to the MDS or given to the Commonwealth in raw data form.</p>
<h4><a id="What_do_I_do_If_the_GP_47_mental_health_provider_has_not_given_an_answer_to_one_or_more_questions_in_the_minimum_dataset_63"></a> What do I do If the GP / mental health provider has not given an answer to one or more questions in the minimum dataset?</h4>
<p>Primary Health Networks should make every effort to ensure that the data entered into the MDS are as complete as possible. However, where information is unavailable, please leave the field blank. The aim is to minimise missing data as much as possible.</p>
<h4><a id="Where_fields_are_consistently_filled_with_the_same_response_40e.g._44_zero_for_co_45payment_where_the_Medicare_Local_is_not_collecting_a_co_45payment_41_44_can_the_minimum_dataset_be_set_to_automatically_fill_this_field_with_the_same_response_each_time_information_is_entered_63_How_can_this_be_done_63"></a> Where fields are consistently filled with the same response (e.g., zero for co-payment where the Primary Health Network is not collecting a co-payment), can the minimum dataset be set to automatically fill this field with the same response each time information is entered? How can this be done?</h4>
<p>Strategic Data can create a template to auto fill this information for you. Such customisations are outside of the Commonwealth funding for the MDS, so such modifications would be billable to your Primary Health Network, and the exact cost would depend on the amount and type of customisations required. Contact the support team via e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
<h4><a id="Can_I_go_back_and_enter_information_if_I_don_146t_have_it_at_the_time_63"></a> Can I go back and enter information if I don’t have it at the time?</h4>
<p>Yes, the MDS allows you to go back and enter information at a later date.</p>
<h3><a id="PATIENT_DATA"></a> Patient data</h3>
<h4><a id="Should_the_question:_39How_well_does_the_person_speak_English_63_146_only_be_answered_if_the_person_has_identified_that_they_speak_a_language_other_than_English_44_or_should_39very_good_39_be_selected_if_they_speak_only_English_63"></a> Should the question: 'How well does the person speak English?’ only be answered if the person has identified that they speak a language other than English, or should 'very good' be selected if they speak only English?</h4>
<p>Please only answer this question if the person has identified that they speak a language other than English.</p>
<h4><a id="How_is_it_determined_whether_the_person_is_a_low_45income_earner_63"></a> How is it determined whether the person is a low-income earner?</h4>
<p>One of the key aims of the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care initiative is to provide access to mental health care for people who would otherwise miss out. Low-income earners are therefore an important target group, and it is important that the MDS provides enough information to determine whether access is being improved for this group. GPs frequently make judgements about patients’ ability to pay a co-payment when they seek care for other conditions. As in other cases, the GP might base the decision on whether the patient has a health care card or is on a pension, but may also choose to take other factors into account.</p>
<h4><a name="SLK_Mandatory"></a> SLK mandatory</h4>
<p>All patient records require an SLK (Statistical Linkage Key) if they have an associated referral or session dated 1st June 2013 or later.  This field has become a mandatory reporting item and is outlined here: <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/slk/</a></p>
<p>Note: once you save/upload a patient record and assign an SLK, you will not be able to delete or remove the SLK - you can, however, edit the SLK for such records.</p>
<h4><a id="If_children_are_under_ATAPS_44_what_happens_to_data_on_them_with_regard_to_the_minimum_dataset_63"></a> If children are under ATAPS, what happens to data on them with regard to the minimum dataset?</h4>
<p>The MDS largely mirrors the data that would be being collected by Primary Health Networks for administrative purposes. No names are supplied to the MDS for evaluation purposes, and patients will not be identified by local or national evaluators. The issue is really about whether informed consent needs to be elicited from minors to receive services, and this is more an implementation question than an evaluation question.</p>
<h4><a id="When_creating_a_new_referral_in_the_minimum_dataset_44_there_is_a_question_on_the_highest_level_of_education_completed._What_option_do_I_choose_if_a_patient_has_completed_less_than_Secondary:Year_10_63"></a> When creating a new referral in the minimum dataset, there is a question on the highest level of education completed. What option do I choose if a patient has completed less than Secondary:Year 10?</h4>
<p>Patients who have completed Years 7, 8 or 9 should be included in the “Secondary: Year 10” response option so this encompasses Years 7 to 10 (in other words the response option should read “Secondary: Year 10 or below”).</p>

<h3><a id="REFERRAL_DATA"></a> Referral data</h3>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_add_a_new_referral_to_a_new_patient_63"></a> How do I add a new referral to a new patient?</h4>
<p>You first need to complete the new patient data in order to enter referral data. Once this has been done, you can then proceed to enter your referral data in the 'referral' section of the online form.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_add_a_new_referral_to_an_existing_patient_63"></a> How do I add a new referral to an existing patient?</h4>
<p><strong>If entering data individually into the MDS:</strong> When in your patient record in the MDS, locate the 'Referrals' box on the right. To the far right you will see a link "New". Click on this link and this will enable you to add your new referral data against the existing patient. This will also enable you to enter new scores for any <a href="../../help/outcome-measures/index.html"> outcome measures</a> you wish to record for sessions completed against this new referral.</p>
<p><strong>If doing a bulk upload:</strong> Simply add a new line entry into your 'Referral' file and assign a new referral code against an existing patient key.</p>
<h4><a id="When_is_it_appropriate_to_add_a_new_referral_to_an_existing_patient_63"></a> When is it appropriate to add a new referral to an existing patient?</h4>
<p>ATAPS allows for up to 12 sessions (6 + 6) per patient within a calendar year. When patients complete their first 6 sessions, they are required to obtain agreement from their referring practitioner (e.g., GP) for continuation of treatment, whereby a further 6 sessions can be allocated. This review is NOT considered a new referral unless the patient has developed a new mental health problem or is being referred to a different MHP. (In exceptional circumstances, an additional 6 sessions might be allocated for a maximum of 18 sessions within a calendar year period.) Also, sessions that continue under an existing treatment plan into a new calendar year do not require a new referral.</p>
<p>A new referral is issued under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new patient is referred for the first time for a presenting mental health condition</li>
<li>an existing patient has presented with a new mental health condition and is being referred for treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to maintain the same patient key for a single patient within the MDS regardless of the number of referrals in order to identify how many sessions in total each patient has had across the lifespan of the program.</p>
<h4><a id="How_can_I_change_the_42referral_type_42_for_a_patient_63"></a> How can I change the <strong>referral type</strong> for a patient?</h4>
<p>One of the limitations to the MDS is that once the 'referral type' has been selected and saved for a record it cannot be changed. Each 'referral type' has its own set of associated data fields which are generated once this field is set. Therefore we have intentionally disabled the edit function linked to this field to circumvent any accidental loss of data.</p>
<p>Therefore the only way to change a 'referral type' is to re-enter the entire record again with the correct 'referral type' and delete the incorrect record.</p>
<h4>Which Referral Type should I select?  When entering patients as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander do I choose 'General ATAPS' or 'Aboriginal and TSI' for the referral type?</h4>
<p>The referral type is based on which Tier program the patient is being referred to; therefore, you need to assign the appropriate Tier to which the patient is being referred (Tier 1 = General ATAPS or Tier 2 = Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, Suicide Prevention, etc.). This is primarily identified by the patient's presenting issue, but often, this will be dependent upon the funding pool to which the MHPro selected is funded through (e.g., General ATAPS or ATSI, etc.).  This is in addition to selecting the appropriate patient demographic details of 'Aboriginal or TSI'.</p>
<h4><a id="Referrals_for_Children"></a> Referrals for children</h4>
<p>The ATAPS Operational Guidelines (Jan 2012) state the following:<br /> "For the purposes of ATAPS, children are defined as being 11 years of age or under (or up to and including 15 years of age in exceptional circumstances where clinically needed and appropriate)."</p>
<h4><a id="Where_can_I_obtain_a_referral_form_63"></a> Where can I obtain a referral form?</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, GP referral forms have been created by the individual Primary Health Networks (they must align to the MDS fields).</p>
<p>There is a sample template at the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing website, which you can use : </p>
<p><a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/mental-ba-gpsamp">http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/mental-ba-gpsamp</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you use a search engine to search for mental health care plan (or Item 2710) referral templates, many Primary Health Networks have the forms they are using available on the web for you to browse.</p>
<h3><a id="SESSION_DATA"></a> Session data</h3>
<h4><a id="Is_the_number_of_sessions_limited_to_six_in_the_minimum_dataset_63_In_our_project_we_are_allowing_the_service_provider_flexibility_in_how_they_utilise_the_total_session_time._The_six_45hour_total_is_the_same_44_but_they_can_break_it_into_shorter_sessions_and_include_phone_calls_40to_follow_up_homework_activities_etc_41_44_so_there_may_be_say_twelve_contacts_47sessions_rather_than_six._Will_the_system_handle_that_63"></a> Is the number of sessions limited to six in the minimum dataset? In our project we are allowing the service provider flexibility in how they utilise the total session time. The six-hour total is the same, but they can break it into shorter sessions and include phone calls (to follow up homework activities etc), so there may be say twelve contacts/sessions rather than six. Will the system handle that?</h4>
<p>The minimum dataset is able to handle this, as well as where upon review it is suggested that the patient have an additional six sessions. After you have entered details of six sessions, another screen with another six will appear and so on.</p>
<h4>If the patient did not attend, should this still be entered in the minimum dataset?</h4>
<p>Yes, entering this data is mandatory. The date of the 'did not attend', the 'no show' checkbox, and whether a co-payment was charged should be provided, but other session fields such as duration and intervention should be left blank.</p>
<h4><a id="How_are_145no_shows_146_entered_63"></a> How are ‘no shows’ entered?</h4>
<p>There is a 'no show' checkbox. Tick this to track non-attendance.  As of 1st June, 2013, this field has become mandatory for non-attendance.</p>
<h4><a name="Available_sessions_per_patient"></a> Do 'no shows' affect the number of sessions available per patient?</h4>
<p>It is up to the discretion of the individual Primary Health Network whether they will count a 'no show' against the available sessions for a patient. It is at the Primary Health Network level that the policies in relation to this matter rest.</p>
<p>However, in terms of capturing this information on the MDS, there is no limit to how many sessions a patient record may contain, and it is mandatory that 'no shows' are recorded in the MDS.</p>
<h4><a id="When_collecting_and_comparing_changes_in_outcome_tool_score_as_part_of_the_local_evaluation_44_are_Medicare_Locals_asking_the_mental_health_professional_to_administer_the_second_outcome_tool_at_the_final_session_or_are_GPs_administering_the_second_tool_in_the_review_phase_of_the_3_steps_63"></a> With regard to co-payment amount, is this meant to be the fee paid by project to provider, or fee paid by project to provider plus patient contribution, or just patient contribution? If it is the latter, none of my providers receive a patient contribution so the total data would show zero.</h4>
<p>The co-payment is the amount paid by the patient, so in many cases it will quite correctly be zero.</p>
<h4><a name="Available_sessions_per_patient"></a> When collecting and comparing changes in outcome tool score as part of the local evaluation, are Primary Health Networks asking the mental health professional to administer the second outcome tool at the final session or are GPs administering the second tool in the review phase of the 3 steps?</h4>
<p>This varies from one Primary Health Network to another. Some feel it is fairer if the GP administers the initial assessment and the MHP administers the final. Others feel it is important that the same person administers the pre- and post-treatment tests. Primary Health Networks interested in incorporating this information into their evaluation should decide what suits their situation and be clear about the administration method when describing results. GPs usually administer the Kessler-10 and MHPs use a range of outcome measures suited to either the presenting issue (e.g. depression, anxiety) and/or the specific sociodemographics of the patient (e.g., age, indigenous status). For the purposes of the national evaluation, it is more important that the outcome measure with pre- and post-treatment data is uploaded/entered into the MDS regardless of which provider obtained the information. There is also provision on the MDS to enter scores on more than one outcome measure. In order for outcome data to be included in the national evaluation, it is recommended that one of the most commonly used outcome measures under ATAPS is used.</p>
<h4><a name="MULTIPLE_SESSIONS_PER_DAY"></a> Recording multiple sessions per day</h4>
<p>* If you enter data directly into the MDS, you can have as many (up to the session limits) sessions assigned to a referral on the same day.<br />* If you upload, you are either limited to one session per referral per day, or have to use the 'upload sessions dated' feature.</p>
<p>( The limitation is within the upload file format as it does not have enough unique details to determine if a session is a duplicate or a subsequent session on the same day. )</p>
<h4>How many sessions can a patient have in a calendar year?</h4>
<p>In one calendar year a patient can access up to a maximum of 18 individual sessions and/or 12 Group sessions - this is regardless of the number of referrals provided.</p>
<h4>Can I link sessions in a new calendar year to a referral from the previous calendar year?</h4>
<p>Yes, provided the referral is still valid - a referral is valid for 12 consecutive months from the date it is written.</p>
<h4>If I link sessions in a new calendar year to a referral from a previous calendar year, does the count of sessions against the referral reset? i.e. If they have already used 5 sessions against the one referral in 2014, does the session count go back to 0 sessions for 2015?</h4>
<p>No. Each referral is valid for 12 months and can have 6 individual sessions + 6 more individual sessions upon review (with another 6 individual sessions in exceptional circumstances) and/or 12 group sessions, before the referral expires. </p>
<p>The 'reset' that can cause confusion refers to the total number of sessions (18) available to each patient per calendar year - not the total number of sessions available per referral.</p>
<h3><a name="MENTAL_HEALTH_PROFESSIONAL_AND_REFERRER_CODES"></a>Mental health professional and referrer codes</h3>
<p>The purpose of using codes is to de-identify the individual MHPs and referrers in the MDS, so that their data in the MDS is kept confidential and has no way of being traced to the individual MHPs/referrers, and therefore, patients.</p>
<p>MHP and referrer codes are assigned and managed by each Primary Health Network. You can devise a simple numeric coding system (e.g., 001) or a combination of both (e.g., AJ100). Most Primary Health Networks keep registers, such as a spreadsheet, which lists the codes and the names of the MHPs/referrers that each code is assigned to. This register is entirely managed by your Primary Health Network and should be securely maintained.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_add_a_new_MHP_code_in_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I add a new MHP code in the MDS?</h4>
<p>You select an MHP code in the 'Session' section of the MDS by simply scrolling down the drop down menu in the 'MHP' field. If you want to add a new MHP, just type in the new MHP code in the MHP field and upon saving the session the new MHP code will be created. The new MHP code will appear in the drop down list next time you enter a session for your Primary Health Network.</p>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the MDS home page, click on the link 'Manage MHPs'.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Create new MHP' link.</li>
<li>Enter the MHP code.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Save' button.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: MHP and referrer codes must be unique. You cannot assign the same code for an MHP and a referrer.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_add_a_new_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I add a new referrer code in the MDS?</h4>
<p>You select a referrer code in the 'Referral details' section of the MDS by scrolling down the drop down menu in the 'Referrer code' field. If you want to add a new referrer, you simply type in the new referrer code in the 'Referrer' field and upon saving the referral the new referrer code will be created. The new referrer code will appear in the drop down list next time you enter a referral for your Primary Health Network.</p>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the MDS home page, click on the link 'Manage referrers'.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Create new referrer' link.</li>
<li>Enter the referrer code.</li>
<li>Select the appropriate referrer type.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Save' button.</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: MHP and referrer codes must be unique. You cannot assign the same code for an MHP and a referrer.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_change_an_existing_MHP_or_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I change an existing MHP or referrer code in the MDS?</h4>
<p>You can manage MHP and referrer codes for your Primary Health Network via the 'Manage MHPs' and 'Manage referrers' links located on the MDS home page. This is an effective administrative tool for updating these codes in bulk. For example, to manage your MHPs codes there is an option to 'Create New MHP' as well as a 'List all MHPs'. This latter link allows you to view all of your Primary Health Network's MHP codes. You can use this option to locate codes and change them if necessary. To change an MHP code, simply locate it, click 'Edit', delete the old code by placing your cursor in the box and using the delete key on your keyboard. Then type in the new code and click on 'Submit query'. Once you have updated the MHP or referrer code, any associated records will automatically update to reflect the changed code.</p>
<p>The same process is available for managing referrer codes.</p>
<h4><a name="How_do_I_delete_referrer_or_MHPRo_codes"></a> How do I delete a 'referrer' or 'MHPro' codes?</h4>
<p>Deleting codes for referrers of MHPros can only be deleted if they do not have any patient, referral or sessions records attached to them. </p>
<p>1. From the MDS home page click on either the 'Manage Referrers' or 'Manage MHPros' link.<br />2. Enter the referrer code in the search box then click on 'Submit Query'. Alternatively, you can click on 'List All'.   This will produce a search results list.<br />3. The column on the far right-hand-side, titled 'Actions', should provide a link to either 'edit' or 'delete'. Note: the 'delete' optionis only available if there are no referral records containing this referrer code (or sessions records with the MHPro code). The 'Last Referral' column will provide more information on when this referrer last referred a patient.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_merge_a_duplicate_MHP_or_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I merge a duplicate MHP or referrer code in the MDS?</h4>
<p>Sometimes users find that codes for MHPs or referrers have been duplicated in error or as a result of the Primary Health Network data migration process (where multiple amalgamating Primary Health Network Local data was merged into the one Primary Health Network data set in the MDS.) In December 2012, a new feature was added to the MDS to enable users to merge duplicate codes.</p>
<p>To merge MHP or referrer codes, locate the code you wish to change using either the 'Manage Referrers' or 'Manage MHPs' link located on the MDS home page. Then use the 'Search' function or the 'List All' link to locate the appropriate code. Click on 'Edit' then simply remove the code and type in the new code, then click on 'Save'. If the system detects that this code already exists within your dataset, it will produce an option to 'Merge' the two. Click on the action button 'Merge' if you wish to do so.</p>
<h4><a id="Should_GP_and_mental_health_providers_names_be_entered_into_the_Minimum_Dataset_to_identify_them_63"></a> Should GP and mental health providers names be entered into the Minimum Dataset to identify them?</h4>
<p>It is preferable that GP and MHP names not be entered into the minimum dataset for reasons of confidentiality. An appropriate alternative is to assign a code to represent each of the GPs/MHPs who are referring clients as part of ATAPS. You can use any coding system of your choice (i.e. letters, numbers, initials, etc.); the idea is just for you to be able to distinguish one provider from another when looking up data after it has been entered.</p>

<h3><a name="MANAGING_CODES_IN_THE_MDS"></a> Managing codes in the MDS</h3>
<p>The MDS requires that Primary Health Networks manage their own coding systems for the provision of the following codes: </p>
<p>1)      Patient Key</p>
<p>2)      Referrer and</p>
<p>3)      MHPro codes</p>
<p>(this is in addition to the SLK)</p>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
<p>Codes must not identify the individual in any way.</p>
<p>Codes must be unique.  Therefore, once a code is used within the MDS, the same code cannot be allocated again, to a different individual.  Primary Health Networks may keep secure records to help them distinguish what codes have been allocated to their referrers and MHPros.</p>
<p>All three codes<strong> </strong>must be a minimum of 2 characters and a maximum of 50.</p>
<p><strong>How to manage codes when Primary Health Networks have multiple data entry users:</strong></p>
<p>It is best that these codes be centrally managed, within a defined coding convention, in order to avoid duplication of codes across the different data entry users.  Therefore, if a central contact is managing this process, he/she can either create the codes then issue these to the users, or he/she could provide details to each provider of how these codes are to be managed by them.  For example, you could have a simple numeric coding system for patient keys, yet each data entry person may be allocated a specific suffix or prefix, in order to easily identify where this record originated from.  For example, XYZ123.  This would suggest that patient record ‘123’ was entered and managed by the organisation or MHPRO ‘XYZ’.  This will enable users to refer any queries they may have relating to this record, to the appropriate organisation/MHPRO (should any data problems be identified with this particular record).  It would be advisable for the Primary Health Network’s central MDS contact to keep a register of what Organisations/MHPros are allocated which codes/prefixes/suffixes.</p>
<p><strong>Regular data set review</strong>: the person managing the central MDS role should regularly undertake a review and audit of the data to ensure it is as expected, across all data entry providers.  Undertaking this regularly will avoid any significant problems escalating.  This review can be done by downloading your Primary Health Network’s dataset (for patients, referrals and sessions) and checking this with other data which you maintain internally, such as invoicing, reports, etc., and ensuring these match up.</p>
<h3>Outcome measures</h3>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_include_outcome_measures_in_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I include outcome measures in the MDS?</h4>
<p>It is possible to upload outcome measure data using the <a href="../../help/file-transfers/index.html#Uploads">bulk upload process</a>, and it is also possible to enter data manually for these measures using the MDS online form. For the latter you will need to select the specific measures used by your Primary Health Network. You can do this yourself by following these instructions:</p>
<p>To view and/or select specific outcome measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the ‘Select Outcome Measures’ link located on the homepage of the MDS.</li>
<li>Check the boxes for the outcome measures you wish to include in your Primary Health Network's MDS.</li>
<li>Click on the ‘Save’ button.</li>
</ol>
<p>After successfully completing these steps, your selected outcomes measures will automatically appear on the MDS online form each time you undertake your data entry. If you no longer require certain outcome measures, you can follow these same steps to uncheck the boxes of the outcome measures you no longer require.</p>
<h4><a id="When_treatment_resumes_after_a_patient_39s_outcome_measure_scores_have_been_recorded_44_how_do_I_record_the_new_scores_to_capture_additional_sessions_63"></a> When treatment resumes after a patient's outcome measure scores have been recorded, how do I record the new scores to capture additional sessions?</h4>
<p>Once the 'before' and 'after' outcome measure scores have been recorded, it is assumed that the treatment has been finalised. Therefore, any further sessions must be recorded against a new referral; however, the existing patient key should be maintained.</p>
<h4><a name="Can_I_capture_additional_outcome_scores"></a> Can I capture additional outcome scores?</h4>
<p>The MDS captures only initial measures, which are typically recorded on or around the referral date, and then final measures are usually taken on or around the final session date.  There is no provision for recording of interim measures which may be taken by the MHP in between the initial and final scores.</p>
<h4><a id="Outcome_Scores"></a> Outcome scores</h4>
<p>The MDS (V4) automatically calculates the total scores using the data provided in the individual items or subscores. If these were not provided, the MDS will produce either a blank score or '99'. The difference between the two is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blank entries - This indicates that no data has been entered/uploaded for the measure.</li>
<li>99 or 999 data values - This indicate that EITHER:<ol>
<li>The total score cannot be automatically calculated (usually due to insufficient individual measure scores were recorded), or</li>
<li>The total was recorded as 99</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h4><a id="Which_outcome_measures_should_be_used_used_and_uploaded_47entered_into_the_MDS_63"></a> Which outcome measures should be used used and uploaded/entered into the MDS?</h4>
<p>While there are a number of outcome measures available for use on the minimum dataset, under the ATAPS program you are encouraged to use the following most commonly (or applicable to specific sup-populations) used outcome measures to enable comparison of client outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kessler 10 (K-10) for adults and/or adolescents aged 16 years and over;

<li>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPNDS) for consumers referred to the Perinatal Depression sub-program;</li>
<li>Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI) for consumers referred to the Specialist Services for Consumers at Risk of Suicide sub-program;</li>
<li>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for children aged 4 to 17 years Version mandated for national use in Australia's specialised mental health services
<ul>
<li>PC1a - SDQ for the parents of 4-10 year olds to complete at initial assessment</li>
<li>PY1a - SDQ for the parents of 11-17 year olds to complete at initial assessment</li>
<li>YR1a - SDQ for self-completion by 11-17 year olds at initial assessment
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SDQ scores (sub and total) are constructed from a core set of 25 items, plus a subset of another 17 (depending on version).  Items 28-32 are used for the impact score. Items 33-42 are not included as it is a minimum data set and these are not required for the sub and totals calculation. (The form used is contained on the <a href="http://www.sdqinfo.com">www.sdqinfo.com</a> site.)</p>
<p>The MDS currently has 6 subscales defined for the SDQ Measures. Five are based on those core 25 items: Emotional symptoms, Conduct problems, Hyperactivity, Peer Problem and Prosocial. The "total" score is determined from the first 4 of these.  The 6th subscale is "Impact", calculated from items 28 to 32.   The discrepancy between the number of subscales in the MDS and those on the Youth in Mind webpage is due to the MDS being only a miminum dataset (therefore aiming at only capturing minimum data).<br /> <br /> If you are using the online "youth in mind" calculator to obtain your SDQ Scores, that site uses two different labels for the scores, outlined below: <br /> <br /> The different SDQ scores have been called various names for different audiences:<br />  Score for overall stress =&gt; Total difficulties score<br />  Score for emotional distress =&gt; Emotional symptoms score<br />  Score for behavioural difficulties =&gt; Conduct problems score<br />  Score for hyperactivity and attentional difficulties =&gt; Hyperactivity/inattention score<br />  Score for difficulties getting along with other children =&gt; Peer problems score<br />  Score for kind and helpful behaviour =&gt; Prosocial score<br />  Score for the impact of any difficulties on the child's life =&gt; Impact score</p>
<p>N.B. The SDQ asks about symptoms over the past 6 months. It is suggested that at post-treatment this is amended to capture symptoms over the past month only.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_view_reports_on_before_and_after_scores_40of_outcome_measures_41_63"></a> How do I view reports on before and after scores (of outcome measures)?</h4>
<p>There is no automatic report that generates this data for you. However, you can easily access this data for your Primary Health Network via the 'Download' data feature in the MDS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the 'File Transfers' link in the right hand menu in the MDS.</li>
<li>In the 'File Downloads' section, select the date range you wish to download.</li>
<li>Select 'Referrals' for Type.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Include measures' box just under the Type. (if you don't click on this the measures won't be included in the download)</li>
<li>Click on download then save the file to your drive.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will produce a .csv file which you can then view and sort through either via MS Excel or another spreadsheet or database.</p>
<h3><a id="UPLOADING_DATA_FROM_OTHER_DATABASES"></a> Uploading data from other databases</h3>
<h4><a id="Uploading_Data"></a> Uploading data</h4>
<p>Read the <a href="../upload-checklist/index.html">Upload Checklist</a> for a quick guide to uploading your data in bulk to the MDS. Full details regarding <a href="../../help/file-transfers/index.html#Uploads">UPLOADS</a> can be found on the MDS ONLINE HELP.</p>
<h4><a id="How_do_I_obtain_a_template_to_upload_my_data_to_the_MDS_63"></a> How do I obtain a template to upload my data to the MDS?</h4>
<p>The upgrade released in December 2010 introduced additional fields to the MDS. This affects the format in which your data can be uploaded. You can create your own template to obtain the exact format and column headings required for a successful upload to the MDS by undertaking the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter dummy/test data manually in the MDS using the online form. You will need to enter complete data for the patient, referral and sessions sections, as well as outcome measures. Ensure you enter enough data to cover every ‘Referral type’ option relevant to your Primary Health Network. (The ‘Referral type’ options reflect the different program types available under both Tier 1 and 2. Therefore, if your Primary Health Network participates in every program, you will need to enter seven dummy/test records, in order to cover all seven referral type options. (The MDS will generate different fields, according to which ‘Referral type’ option you select. Therefore, by creating a separate record for every referral type, you will ensure every field is covered.)</li>
<li>Once you have entered enough dummy/test data to reflect every ‘Referral type’ option and ‘Outcome measures’ relevant to your Primary Health Network, you can now ‘Download’ your data to produce a csv file for ‘patient’, ‘referral’ and ‘sessions’ data. (Please refer to <a href="index.html#HowToDownloadData">'How do I download my data from the MDS'</a> for instructions on downloading your data from the MDS).</li>
<li>The files produced from your download are the exact format and sequence required for uploading your data. Therefore, you can copy the column headings into a blank spreadsheet to create your upload template. You can also use the data content of your download files to understand the data types accepted for each data field. More information on data uploads is available on the <a href="../../help/file-transfers/index.html">MDS Online Help</a>.</li>

<p>It is important that all Primary Health Network running ATAPS use the minimum dataset in order to provide a national picture of who is accessing ATAPS services and what services are being provided. If you find that entering all of the data into the minimum dataset is too burdensome, you are able to utilise a portion of your evaluation funds to pay someone to do the data entry. Please note that you will need to provide this person with some brief training in how to use the minimum dataset. There is some functionality for Data Upload if your Primary Health Network has an alternative means of collecting and storing the minimum dataset data, for example Excel or Access. Information on this procedure can be found at <a href="index.html#UPLOADING_DATA_FROM_OTHER_DATABASES">'Uploading data from other databases'</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="What_do_I_do_if_I_have_collected_the_data_in_Excel_or_Access_63"></a> What do I do if I have collected the data in Excel or Access?</h4>
<p>See the online <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html">MDS documentation regarding uploads</a>. Note that the data upload method of submitting data exposes you to more risk of data loss since it relies on the user to be aware of more issues with the data submission process. This feature is best used where a software/database developer is engaged to extract data from an existing system, converting it into a format suitable for upload. If you don't already have a satisfactory system that can be modified to export the required upload files, consider using the online data entry interface thoroughly before making your decision. You can ask further questions about the process by emailing <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>.</p>
<p>A detailed document for data uploads is available on our website, see <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html">Upload File Format</a>.</p>

<p>Primary Health Networks are able to access their minimum dataset data at any time even after entering information. Be sure that you keep a record of Patient Keys (unique identifiers) so that you can look up specific patient information already entered into the minimum dataset. There are links patient.csv, session.csv and datadict.csv in the data download section of the Main Page. It extracts only your own Primary Health Network's information. This can be imported into other programs (e.g., Excel, SPSS) and you can manipulate the data for your internal use.</p>
