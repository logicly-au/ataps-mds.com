<p>Historically there were many measures available for organisations to collect, however some of these measures were either inappropriate or not commonly used. Pre and post treatment scores for a given consumer on less frequently used outcome measures are not included in statistical analyses for the national evaluation. For these reasons the outcome measures are being standardised and inappropriate or not commonly used ones are being phased out.</p>
<h2>Standard Measures</h2>
<p>The standard measures are shown at the top of the page. Organisations can turn these measures on or off as appropriate to the organisation.</p>
<h2>Non-completion measure</h2>
<p>Underneath the standard measures is the Non-Completion measure. There are good reasons why a measure may not be completed i.e. patient refusal. This measure allows for that information to be recorded.Â </p>
<h2>Other Outcome Measures</h2>
<p>These are all the non standard measures that are being phased out. Once an organisation turns these outcome measures off, they will no longer be able to turn them back on again.</p>
