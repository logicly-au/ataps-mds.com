    <h1>ATAPS Help - Patients</h1>
<p><strong>To create a new patient</strong>, enter a new patient key into the search box on the Home page, then click the "Create new" button. You'll be taken to a blank form (with only the patient key you just entered filled in) for you to create &amp; save.</p>
<p>NOTE: The MDS will only accept patient key codes with a minimum of 3 characters long and a maximum of 50.</p>
<p>The following fields are captured in the patient record:</p>
<p>Patient Key, Birth Year, Gender, SLK, Language Spoken at Home, English Level, Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander. </p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>1. In September 2012, the SLK (Statistical Linkages Key) was introduced as a new field and as of 1st June, 2013 is a mandatory reporting requirement. Once a patient record has been assigned an SLK you cannot delete/remove the SLK, you can only edit it.  <a href="../../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">Read more on SLK.</a></p>
<p>2. The 'Language spoken at home' field provides a limited list of pre-defined languages.  If the language spoken at home is not available within this list, please use the 'Language other' field to type in the patient's language.</p>

<h2><a id="Locating_Historical_Patient_Records"></a> Locating Historical Patient Records</h2>
<p>The MDS data migration (2015) brought in records for active patients within the past 12 months. All other data remained within the former organisational database(s). However, MDS users still have the ability to access patient records that reside within their amalgamating/historical organisations.</p>
<p>When trying to locate historical patient records follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the MDS homepage, enter the patient key into the patient key box, then click on ‘search’. A new section called ‘search results’ will appear below.</li>
<li>The ‘search results’ will have a red link located on the top right hand side of this section called ‘Repeat search on historical divisions’. If your patient key was not found, click on this link to run the search again through your historical/amalgamating organisations.</li>
<li>If your patient record was located within one of your historical organisations you will see the option to ‘take’ this record. If you wish, click on the ‘take’ button to bring this patient record into your current dataset.</li>
<li>If there were no results you may need to create a new patient record.</li>
</ol>
<p>When viewing a patient record, the patient's referrals will be displayed in the box on the right. To edit the patient record, click the "edit" link in the heading. This will take you to an editable form for that patient record.</p>
<p>To edit or add a referral, use the links in the "Referrals" box on the right of the patient page.</p>
