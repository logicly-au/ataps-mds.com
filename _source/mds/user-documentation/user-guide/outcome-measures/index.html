<p>On the referral page, the associated measures are listed in the "Measures" box on the right side. To view the details of each individual measure, click on the measure name, or the "edit" link next to it to go directly to the editing view.</p>

<p>Once on the measure page, the patient summary box will continue to show on the right, as will the measures box, indicating which of the measures you are viewing, and which referral they belong to. The page heading will also give you context as to which measure you are editing.</p>
<p> <a href="../../../../site/assets/files/1039/measures_3_edit.png"><img src="../../../../site/assets/files/1039/measures_3_edit.406x0.png" width="406" height="174" alt="" /></a> <a href="../../../../site/assets/files/1039/measures_4_edit.png"><img src="../../../../site/assets/files/1039/measures_4_edit.406x0.png" width="406" height="166" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>There are up to three options for entering data when editing (or creating) a measure - individual, subscales and total. (Subscales may or may not be available to enter, depending on whether the measure you are editing supports it.) Select the type you wish to enter by clicking the radio button; then enter the data into the field(s) that appear below. <strong>You only need to enter one type - individual scores OR total OR subscales.</strong></p>

<p>To add a new measure, click the "New" link in the measures box on the right side. On the subsequent page, click on the type of measure you want to add. You will then be taken to an "edit" view of the measure, where you can enter scores as described above. A special type of measure, called the Non Completion measure, exists. If no measure has been collected then the Non Collection measure can be added in order to formally record this.</p>

<p><strong>Administrators may select which measures apply to their organisation.</strong> To do so, on the home page first select the organisation you wish to select measures for, then click the "Select Outcome Measures" link on the right side. On the following page, check the measures you wish to use, then click "save".</p>
