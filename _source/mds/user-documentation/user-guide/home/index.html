<p>When you first log in, you will see the home page. This is also the central search page for navigating directly to a patient.</p>
<p>If you have multiple Primary Health Networks, select the Primary Health Network you wish to work within in the drop-down menu labeled "Division".</p>
<p><a href="../../../../site/assets/files/1035/home_search_autocomplete-1.png"><img src="../../../../site/assets/files/1035/home_search_autocomplete-1.400x0.png" width="400" height="241" alt="The Home/Search page with the autocomplete suggestions menu showing" /></a></p>
<p>Start typing the patient key in the Patient key textfield. Once you have typed a few characters, a list of possible matches will appear below the text field. You may keep typing, or select one of the auto-completed suggestions.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen one of the suggestions, or finished typing the key, click the "Go directly to patient" button (or hit "Enter" on your keyboard) to go straight to the patient with that key.</p>
<p>If you're unsure of the patient key, you can click the "search" button instead. This will show you a list of search results that match the characters you've entered in the "Patient key" textfield.</p>

<p>The search results page displays some more detail about each patient with a key that matches your search; you can click on the "View" or "Edit links for the patient you're seeking to either view or edit their record.</p>
<p>You can also use the search box in the top right corner of every page to go directly to a patient record; just enter the patient key and hit "Enter" or click the "Go" button.</p>
