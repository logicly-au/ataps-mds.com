<h2><a id="Evaluation_of_the_Access_to_Allied_Psychological_Services_component_of_the_Better_Outcomes_in_Mental_Health_Care_initiative:_Minimum_Dataset"></a> Evaluation of the <em>Access to Allied Psychological Services</em> component of the <em>Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care</em> initiative: Minimum Dataset</h2>
<ul id="toc"></ul>
<h3><a id="Purpose_of_the_minimum_dataset"></a> Purpose of the minimum dataset</h3>
<p>The minimum dataset was developed to gather common, basic information from all Primary Health Netwoks implementing ATAPS, and therefore acts as an important evaluation tool. The minimum dataset is designed to capture de-identified, consumer-level information. The minimum dataset is invaluable in collecting information that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>a picture of the level of uptake of the projects (by GPs and other referrers, mental health professionals and consumers)</li>
<li>a description of the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of consumers</li>
<li>an overview of the services consumers are receiving</li>
<li>pre- and post-treatment consumer outcomes on standardised outcome measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sociodemographic and clinical information are collected by the GP or referrer, and treatment information is collected by the mental health professional at each session. Importantly, the minimum dataset also captures consumer-level outcome data, which are collected by either/both the GP and mental health professional.</p>
<h3><a id="The_minimum_dataset_system"></a>The minimum dataset system</h3>
<p>The database is a web-based system allowing multiple users and regular reporting at a national level. The database is password-protected, so that only authorised personnel are able to access it to enter data and personnel from a given Primary Health Networks are only able to access their own information.</p>
<p>The minimum dataset was launched in 2003 and all Primary Health Networks are now represented in the database. Primary Health Networks are required to collect and enter the minimum dataset items as part of their ATAPS contracts with the Department of Health and Ageing. The data entered are periodically reported in aggregated form by The University of Melbourne’s Centre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics as part of their national evaluation work. This provides the opportunity to showcase the achievements of this major national initiative and highlights the importance of representation in the dataset by each Primary Health Network.</p>
<h3><a id="Specific_items_in_the_minimum_dataset"></a> Specific items in the minimum dataset</h3>
<p>The items included in the minimum dataset have been selected because they are considered important in the context of the national evaluation. They have been selected to provide a profile of the socio-demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics of ATAPS patients. In developing these items, particular consideration has been given to their comparability with other relevant local, state/territory and national data collections (e.g., the Census, local government statistics, the National Health Survey, the National Mental Health Survey, the BEACH Study).</p>
<p>The two links below outline the items included in the minimum dataset, and the specific response categories associated with each item. Within the minimum dataset, a patient is created first, then a referral is created for the patient, then session information is entered for the referral. Information regarding outcome measures is entered within the referral section of the patient information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="referrer-data-items/index.html">Data items to be collected by the GP or referrer on a patient referral form</a></li>
<li><a href="mhp-data-items/index.html">Data items to be collected by the mental health professional at each session, on an ongoing management form</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The program allows for up to 12 sessions (6 + 6) per patient within a 12 month period from the initial referral date, and up to a maximum total of 18 individual sessions in exceptional circumstances. When patients complete their first 6 sessions they are required to attend their GP for a review, before a further 6 sessions are allowed (if required). This review is NOT considered a new referral unless the patient has developed a new mental health problem or is being referred to a different mental health professional. Therefore, if a patient uses 12 (or 18 in exceptional circumstances) or less sessions within 12 months from the original referral the same referral is maintained for reporting purposes in the minimum dataset against the patient key throughout these sessions. In all circumstances, a referral is only valid for 12 months. Also, if more than the 12 (or 18 in exceptional circumstances) sessions are required beyond the first 12 months of any given referral, a new referral must be issued.</p>
<p>A new referral is issued under these circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new patient is referred for the first time for a presenting mental health condition</li>
<li>an existing patient who has previously been referred to a mental health professional but has used up all 12 sessions within a 12 month period and is requiring further sessions; in this case ensure the existing 'patient key' is used</li>
<li>an existing patient has presented with a new mental health condition and is being referred for treatment; in this case ensure the existing 'patient key' is used</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to maintain the same patient key for a single patient within the minimum dataset, regardless of the number of referrals, in order to identify how many sessions in total each patient has had across the lifespan of the program.</p>
<h3><a id="Changes_related_to_the_Tier_2_Services"></a> Changes related to the Tier 2 Services</h3>

<p>Before an outcome measure can be used, each Primary Health Network will need to enable the relevant outcome measure in the minimum dataset. This can be done by selecting them in the “*select measures*” link on the minimum dataset home page.</p>
<p>Primary Health Networks will be notified of the details of any other changes to the minimum dataset. The current document therefore constitutes a ‘live’ document which may be updated from time to time to reflect the evolving nature of the ATAPS program and the specific categories required to capture ATAPS data on the minimum dataset.</p>
<h3><a id="How_Medicare_Locals_can_access_the_minimum_dataset"></a> How Primary Health Networks can access the minimum dataset</h3>
<p>A dedicated Help Desk is available to support the ATAPS projects in relation to the minimum dataset system. All enquiries should be directed to: <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a></p>
<p>Your Primary Health Network should have a username and password. If you do not have a username and password, please contact <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>. Each Primary Health Network will be issued with at least one username and password which will have the capacity to create other accounts for the Primary Health Network. Each person entering data should be issued with their own account. You should take care not to enter data about the same patient at the same time. Primary Health Networks can also create accounts for GPs and mental health professionals to allow them to enter data themselves. The minimum dataset is accessed on the web at the following address: <a href="../../../index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/</a>.</p>
<p>A brief description of the minimum dataset system is located there including a link to the logon page. The application includes online help for each of the pages. This website provides useful information, tools and documentation to provide support to Primary Health Networks involved in the ATAPS projects. It includes links to: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for the minimum dataset; the collection of ATAPS Evaluation Reports; and to other useful reports, articles and ATAPS Evaluation Presentations.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the minimum dataset can be directed to the following central email address that allows queries to be viewed by all members of the evaluation team: <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a></p>
<h3><a id="Data_Provision"></a> Data Provision</h3>
<p>Primary Health Networks vary in their method of providing data to the national database. While the majority are entering data directly, some are utilising other databases in formats such as Excel and Access (or Chilli and MHAGIC). In order to avoid double entry of data, there is some functionality for Data Upload if your organisation has an alternative means of collecting and storing the minimum dataset items. Information on this procedure can be found in the online Help. You may also contact <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> for assistance.</p>
<p>Data should be entered into the minimum dataset as soon as it becomes available so that at any given time data can be downloaded nationally to provide an overall picture of service provision via ATAPS. Data should be entered as frequently as is possible and should not lag by more than a month. This is also the case where data is being collected via an alternative database; data should be uploaded to the minimum dataset at least monthly.</p>
<p>Primary Health Networks should ensure that the data entered into the minimum dataset are as complete and accurate as possible. The aim is to minimise missing data as much as possible. When data is missing (i.e., it has not been provided or is unknown), please leave these fields blank rather than entering a zero (or multiple nines). For example, when outcome measures have not been completed, please leave these fields blank, so that it is clear to the evaluators that these data are missing. Conversely, where it is known that the correct response is zero, for example, where it is known that no session co-payment is collected, please enter zero rather than leaving the field blank, otherwise this will be interpreted as missing data.</p>
<h3><a id="How_Medicare_Locals_can_use_the_minimum_dataset"></a> How Primary Health Networks can use the minimum dataset</h3>
<p>Primary Health Networks are not required to conduct any analyses of the minimum dataset data for the purposes of the national evaluation, but may wish to do so as part of their local evaluations.</p>
<p>Primary Health Networks are able to access their minimum dataset data at any time even after entering information. Be sure that you keep a record of Patient Keys (unique identifiers) so that you can look up specific patient information already entered into the minimum dataset. This is done from the link to File Transfers on the home page. Select the desired time period (e.g., financial year, quarter) and click “Download”. Each Primary Health Network can only view data that has been entered by that Primary Health Network, not data entered by other Primary Health Networks. The Download function produces a CSV file, which is easily imported into an application such as Excel or SPSS allowing you to manipulate the data for your internal use. It is also possible to create Individual Primary Health Network Reports using the minimum dataset (detailed below).</p>
<h4><a id="Reporting"></a> Reporting</h4>
<p>The minimum dataset enables users to automatically generate a series of individual Primary Health Network reports which give the minimum dataset greater clinical and management utility for Primary Health Networks. In addition, the minimum dataset allows Primary Health Networks to download their own data and import it into an alternative program such as Excel or Access to analyse and generate reports.</p>
<p>The addition of the reporting capability enables Primary Health Networks to generate a series of tables for the minimum dataset fields, including both patient and session data. These tables provide patient or session counts for each of the response options, as well as percentages. Total scores are given both with and excluding missing data or “no response”. These reports present data on consumers referred in a given period (e.g., number, breakdown by demographic and clinical characteristics) and sessions provided in a given period (e.g., number, breakdown by session characteristics). Individual Primary Health Networks are able to compare themselves with the national picture.</p>
<p>The reporting capability is accessed via the minimum dataset home page. Click on the links from the home page: either <strong>Data Summary</strong> or <strong>Report Selection (Frequency Distribution)</strong>. On “Report Selection”, select a report item, (e.g., language spoken at home), and a time period, click view to display the table.</p>
<h4><a id="Functionality"></a> Functionality</h4>
<p><a id="Uploads"></a> Uploads</p>
<p>Primary Health Networks are able to upload data to the minimum dataset, minimising double entry of data if another administrative system is used. It is possible to test whether data can be uploaded.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the updating of the patient data table, to include both information by patient and by referral, affect the way data is uploaded to the minimum dataset. If your Primary Health Network currently uploads data to the minimum dataset, please see the online Help section or contact <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> for information on the required changes to preparation of your data files for upload.</p>
<p><a id="Referrer_and_Mental_Health_Professional_Lists"></a> Referrer and Mental Health Professional Lists</p>
<p>The Referrers and Mental Health Professionals lists allow Primary Health Networks to manage their own codes (they can be renamed and deleted from here). It is also possible to identify which patients are assigned to a particular referrer or mental health professional. Whenever a referrer or mental health professional code is updated, all associated patients must be reallocated to an alternative code. When a Referrer or mental health professional code is updated, the user is prompted for confirmation that all relevant referrals / sessions should be assigned to the updated GP/referrer or mental health professional code and when selected, this then occurs automatically. These can be accessed via the minimum dataset home page via the ‘Manage Referrers’ and ‘Manage AHPros’ links. Further information on how to use these new capabilities can be found in the online Help section of the minimum dataset, accessed from the Main Page.</p>
<p>The minimum dataset will soon be changed to enable more data collection and functionality around referrers and mental health professionals. The evaluators will inform Primary Health Networks about these changes as soon as they occur.</p>
<p><a id="Accessing_Historical_Patient_Records"></a> Accessing Historical Patient Records</p>
<p>The migration of legacy Medicare Local into the new Primary Health Network structure incorporated data from the amalgamated Medicare Locals for the 12 months prior to the data migration process. Historical data (dating 12 months prior to the most recent session added to the legacy Medicare Local) cannot be accessed using the 'search' function (as this applies only to the data that were migrated plus any new data that has been entered into the minimum dataset).</p>
<p>In order to access historical data, click on the 'Repeat search on historical Divisions' link to the right of the search results. Note that this option only comes up after first undertaking a standard ‘search’. If you wish to bring a historical patient record into your current database, you will need to go to the minimum dataset home page and click 'Create new'. Enter the relevant patient key code, then click on the 'take' option which will bring this record across, into your Primary Health Network database.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you enter a new patient key code that happens to be identical to an existing, historical record within your database, you will have the option to either ‘take’ the historical record (and bring it into your current database), or you can proceed to ‘create new’, which will create a new patient record.</p>
<h3><a id="Ethical_issues:_Confidentiality_and_informed_consent"></a> Ethical issues: Confidentiality and informed consent</h3>
<p>Patient confidentiality is paramount. All data should be de-identified (i.e., names and other identifying information removed) before it is provided to the minimum dataset. Patients should only be identified by a unique number and the Statistical Linkage Key (). The unique number and <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a> are necessary to ensure that the patient can be ‘followed’ across their six (to 12 or 18 in exceptional circumstances) sessions with the mental health professional. The unique patient number should be generated by the Primary Health Network, and should not be the responsibility of the referring GP. Whilst maintaining confidentiality of consumers from the evaluators is paramount, Primary Health Networks need to collect sufficient information about each patient to ensure that if the patient receives a new referral during another year (within the same Primary Health Network) that the referral and session information can be entered using the same unique patient number. The <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a> is intended to support the capacity to identify individual clients across time distinguishing between repeat and new clients; although identifying information is entered into the browser to generate the <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>, this information is NOT stored in the minimum dataset.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is preferable that GP and mental health professional names not be entered into the minimum dataset for reasons of confidentiality. An appropriate alternative is to assign a code to represent each of the GPs/referrers/ mental health professionals who are referring clients as part of the project. You can use any coding system of your choice (i.e. letters, numbers, initials, etc.); the idea is just for you to be able to distinguish one provider from another when looking up data after it has been entered.</p>
<p>Information sheets describing each project should be made available to patients at the outset. Patients should be informed that they are participating in a project that is being evaluated, and that data on their socio-demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics will be made available to the evaluators in a form that does not allow them to be identified by name. They should also be informed of the other steps outlined above that will ensure that their confidentiality is protected. It is not considered necessary to seek informed consent from participating patients, but the information sheet should make it clear that if they object to their information being provided to the evaluators that they can choose for it to be withheld.</p>
<p>Approval for the overall national evaluation has been obtained by the national evaluators from the relevant Ethics Committee.</p>
