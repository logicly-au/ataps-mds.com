    <h1>Unique identification of sessions for uploads</h1>
<p>To resolve issues many organisations are having with uploading session data where multiple sessions were delivered for the same referral on the same day, the field 'org_ses_id' has been added to the upload format specification. It is designed to be as flexible as possible for Primary Health Networks and 3rd party products to implement, removing the necessity for using the existing "sessions dated" feature in the MDS.</p>
<p>The 'org_ses_id' field is optional, must be unique for the associated referral and may contain up to 64 printable ASCII characters. The 'org_ses_id' is combined with referral information (patient key and referral date) to provide a unique key for session identification. The MDS uses this composite and unique key to determine if an existing session is being updated or a new record should be created.</p>
<p>There are many possiblities for generating your 'org_ses_id' identifiers. Ideally this should be something meaningful to your Primary Health Network, for example,</p>
<ul>
<li>if your database already has a unique id (primary key) for every session, you may use that; or</li>
<li>a running count of the number of sessions delivered for the specific referral.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a session has been created in the MDS with an 'org_ses_id' identifier, it will not be possible to modify the 'org_ses_id' for the session record in the MDS.</li>
<li>
<div>If two records have the same patient key and referral date, and one has nothing in the org_ses_id field and the other has something in it, they will be considered to be different sessions.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Any record with an org_ses_id value will operate in a "replace duplicates" mode. That is, if the composite key of (patient key, referral date, org_ses_id) identify an existing session record in the MDS it will be updated, otherwise a new record is created.</div>
</li>
</ul>
