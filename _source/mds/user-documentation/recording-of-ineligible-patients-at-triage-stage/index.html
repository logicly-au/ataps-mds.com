    <h1>Recording of ineligible patients at triage stage</h1>
<p>New patients and/or referrals that are deemed ineligible for ATAPS services at the triage stage are generally considered out of scope of the MDS and should therefore not be recorded in the ATAPS-MDS.</p>
<p>It has been brought to our attention that the conclusion “referred elsewhere” is sometimes being incorrectly used to designate referrals that either never resulted in sessions and/or which were originally deemed to be ineligible for ATAPS services. However, this code is purely intended to be used for referrals where sessions have already begun to be delivered but where the patient has been referred to another location, if they moved for example.</p>
<p>Ideally, these out of scope referrals should therefore be removed from the MDS, however this may prove onerous as there is no automatic way of deleting referrals. As an alternative, we have added a new conclusion: “patient ineligible”. Please recode any existing instances of referrals incorrectly using “referred elsewhere” to the conclusion “patient ineligible”.</p>
