    <h1>27 May 2016 - Standard outcome measures</h1>
<p>MDS Update v4.197 was released on May 27, 2016.</p>
<p>Currently there are many outcome measures available for use on the minimum dataset. Some of the measures are either inappropriate or not commonly used by providers. Pre and post treatment scores for a given consumer on less frequently used outcome measures are excluded in statistical analyses for the national evaluation. Further, there is poor completion of the existing outcome measures. This is particularly problematic since a measure pre and post treatment is required in order to analyse consumer outcomes.</p>
<p>To this end, outcome measures are being standardised in the MDS and outcome measure compliance reports have been added. The following measures will be standard in the MDS: </p>
<ul>
<li>Kessler 10 (K10)</li>
<li>Kessler 5 (K5)</li>
<li>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS)</li>
<li>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</li>
<li>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPNDS)</li>
<li>Modified Scaled for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI)</li>
</ul>
<p>All other measures will be phased out over time. Organisations can select which measures they collect within the MDS, however once a non-standard measure has been disabled, organisations will no longer be able to turn it back on.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that there are good reasons why an outcome measure may not be able to be collected. In order to allow for this a Non Completion measure has been added. This measure can be selected in lieu of another measure.</p>
<p>In order to help organisations improve their outcome measure completion and use of standard measures, three new reports have been added to the MDS. These are listed under 'Report selection &gt; Performance Indicators'.</p>
<p><strong>Referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days</strong> - By referral type, shows the number of referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days and also the number of referrals without a conclusion and no session activity for 90+ days as a percentage of referrals without a conclusion. These figures are shown for three time periods - End of previous finanical year, end of last quarter and today so that organisations can track their progress over time.</p>
<p><strong>Measures for resolved referrals</strong> - By referral type, shows the number of measures recorded for resolved referrals. The report breaks the counts down by 'Treatment Completed' and 'Other conclusion'. Within this breakdown the counts are futher broken down by resolved referrals with no measures, resolved referrals with only an initial or final measure and resolved referrals with both an initial and final measure.</p>
<p><strong>Percentage of Standard Measures</strong> - By referral type, shows the percentage of measures used that were standard measures. The report breaks these percentages down by initial collection, final collection and total.</p>
<p>The documentation at <a href="../../help/index.html" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/user-guide/</a> has been updated to reflect these changes.</p>    <div id='last-modified'>
