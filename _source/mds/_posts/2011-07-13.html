<p>For divisions who upload their data, please refer to the 'File Transfer/Upload' notes on the <a href="../../help/file-transfers/index.html#Uploads"> MDS Online Help</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="DIY_Password_recovery"></a> DIY Password recovery</h3>
<p>This allows users who have forgotten their password or username to recover either of these by entering either the registered email address or their Username. The system will issue a new password to the email address that is the authorised user for your ID account.</p>
<h3><a id="Detect_trailing_whitespace_in_uploads"></a> Detect trailing whitespace in uploads</h3>
<p>When uploading your data to the MDS, it necessary to include the exact data that the system accepts. If the system detects spaces after the data, the system will generate an error message and your upload will fail. This has been a widespread issue and the MDS now produces a meaningful error message so that you are able to pinpoint any errors if detected within your dataset.</p>
<h3><a id="Reduction_of_minimum_patient_key_length_from_3_to_2_characters"></a> Reduction of minimum patient key length from 3 to 2 characters</h3>
<p>The MDS now requires new Patient Key codes to be a minimum of 2 characters in length.</p>
<h3><a id="Ability_to_self_manage_40add_47edit_41_new_users_for_your_division"></a> Ability to self manage (add/edit) new users for your division</h3>
<p>Each MDS User account is assigned a specific <em>role</em>. The main authorised MDS users for each division have been assigned a <em>division</em> role. In the new 4.1 version of the MDS, <em>division</em> users can now add and edit new users for their division. More information is available on the <a href="../../help/user-management/index.html">MDS Online Help</a></p>
<h3><a id="Accessing_a_list_of_users_for_your_division"></a> Accessing a list of users for your division</h3>
<p>You can now access a list of all MDS users for your division. More information is available on the <a href="../../help/user-management/index.html#View_List_of_all_users_40for_your_ml_41">MDS Online Help</a></p>    <div id='last-modified'>
