    <h1>2nd March 2015 - Ensuring your data is up to date on the ATAPS MDS</h1>
<p>Dear Medicare Locals,</p>
<p>Please be advised that data will be extracted for various evaluation reports on 30 April, 31 July and 30 September, 2015.</p>
<p>However, the Department often request reports without any notice and it is therefore recommended that ATAPS data is kept as up to date as possible at all times, at minimum monthly.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>The ATAPS Evaluation Team</p>    <div id='last-modified'>
