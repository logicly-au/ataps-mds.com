    <h1>26 February 2016 - MHSRRA Referrals into the MDS</h1>
<p>One of the key features of the Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas (MHSRRA) MHSRRA programme is flexibility in the delivery of services and the engagement of allied and nursing mental health professionals. In recognition of the difficulties experienced in some locations in readily accessing a medical practitioner, some flexibility in the timing of a medical practitioner's involvement may be considered in order for the client to commence to receive services while arrangements are made for the client to see a GP.</p>
<p>However, all clients receiving services under the MHSRRA programme MUST obtain and have ongoing clinical oversight from a medical practitioner.</p>
<p>It is expected that data would be entered into the MDS once a referral has been obtained from a GP.</p>    <div id='last-modified'>
