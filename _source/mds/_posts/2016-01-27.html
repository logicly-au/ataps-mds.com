    <h1>27 January 2016 - MHSRRA uploads to the ATAPS MDS</h1>
<p>The Department expects that all organisations providing MHSRRA services should be entering data from 1 January 2016. The Department doesnÂ¹t expect organisations to back date data before 1 January 2016, however, if organisations hold the information and have capacity to enter the data, it would be advised that they enter data from 1 July 2015 to 31 December 2015.</p>
<p>Referrals received before 1 January 2016 (or 1 July 2015 for those who have the capacity) should be included in the reported data only if sessions were delivered after 1 January 2016 (or 1 July 2015 for those who have the capacity).</p>
<p>For non-PHNs only:<br />The Department understands that the four non-PHN organisations may not be collecting data at the same level as PHNs. These organisations are not expected to establish new data collection systems for the remainder of 2015-16. They are however, expected to enter what data they are already collecting.</p>    <div id='last-modified'>
