    <h1>1st of May, 2013 - MDS Update - Encryption of SLK</h1>
<p>Below is a summary of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historically the MDS has not allowed entry of children with an age less than 3. This restriction has been removed.</li>
<li>In order to alleviate concerns about <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>'s and privacy, <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>'s are now stored and displayed as encrypted strings.</li>
<li>In order to support this encryption, users may now enter or upload either the existing plain text <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a> or an encrypted <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>. Please refer to the <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a> documentation for more information about encryption.</li>
