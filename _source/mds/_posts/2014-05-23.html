    <h1>23rd of May, 2014 - Reminder that Copayment field is to become mandatory in the ATAPS MDS</h1>
<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>This is a reminder that the Copayment field is to become mandatory in the ATAPS MDS from the 1st of June, 2014. This will only apply to sessions dated after the 1st of June, 2014. The copayment field will still be optional for sessions dated before the 1st of June, 2014. This change means that if no copayment was charged, $0 will need to be entered into the copayment field.</p>
<p>This change is needed to address a significant percentage of MDS entries that do not complete this data field. It is important that the Department has information on the proportion of ATAPS services charging a copayment and the level of that copayment per individual service.For those who upload their data in bulk, the data specifications are outlined on the Upload File Format documentation for sessions: <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html#session-fields-available-to-all-program-types" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/file-format/#session-fields-available-to-all-program-types</a></p>
<p>For third party developers who wish to test their uploads, test accounts are available on the MDS that can be used to test uploads prior to the 1st of June deadline. Please email <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> if you would like to use this functionality. Many third party developers already have a test account. On request we will make the copayment field mandatory on these accounts. If you are a third party developer and would like to test uploads but don't yet have a test account please follow the instructions at https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/faq/#im-a-third-party-software-developer-developing-sof but also request that we make the copayment field mandatory on the account.</p>
