    <h1>Program Evalulation</h1>
<p>The Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) initiative has a strong commitment to evaluation. As a consequence, The University of Melbourne’s <a href="http://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-and-institutes/centre-for-health-policy">Centre for Health Policy</a> (formerly the Centre for Health Policy, Programs and Economics) has been commissioned to provide evaluation support to Primary Health Networks implementing this initiative.</p>
<p>Our support role recognises that Primary Health Networks have varying levels of evaluation expertise, may be using internal or external evaluators, and are employing different evaluation designs. In the main, this support takes the form of individual and group consultations with interested Primary Health Networks, as well as written documentation about key evaluation issues.</p>
<p>Our role also includes the development and dissemination of a minimum dataset. The minimum dataset is designed to capture de-identified consumer-level information, which is invaluable for describing who is accessing mental health care as a result of ATAPS, as well as for providing a broad overview of the care consumers are receiving.</p>
<p>Periodically, we draw together information from the minimum dataset and purpose-designed surveys and interviews to provide ongoing information about the progress of ATAPS and whether specific models of service delivery are particularly effective in given circumstances.</p>
<p>Since 2003, we have produced 19 interim evaluation reports and several special reports about various Tier 2 initiatives including, the Telephone-CBT pilot, Suicide Prevention services, the bushfire and flood/cyclone initiatives.  The <a href="../site/assets/files/1016/ten-year-ataps-report_v1-1.pdf">10 year consolidated report(PDF)</a>(111 pages, 2.6MB) or summarises our evaluation findings from July 2003 to December 2012.  For enquiries related to previous reports, please email <a href="mailto:support@atap-mds.com">support@atap-mds.com</a>.   We have also produced several peer-reviewed journal articles.</p>
