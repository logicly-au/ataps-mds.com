<p>Dear Medicare Locals,</p>
<p>Our next evaluation report is due to the Department of Health on the 13th of October. We will be downloading the data for this report in early September. In order for the evaluation report to be as accurate as possible we ask that you please work to have your ATAPS data as up to date as possible in the MDS by the <strong>1st of September 2014</strong>. We will be evaluating <strong>all ATAPS data up until the end of June 2014</strong>.  </p>
<p>We understand that this may not correlate with your planned data upload dates and appreciate that this may require some extra work. If you foresee any problems with this task, or if we can be of any assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a>.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>The ATAPS Evaluation Team at Melbourne University. </p>
