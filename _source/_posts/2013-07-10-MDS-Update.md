<p>MDS Update 4.150 has been released. Below is a summary of the new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum Referral/Session date is 1st of January, 2003.</li>
<li>Postcodes starting with 00, 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07 are not valid or accepted.</li>
<li>File uploads will only pad three digit "postcodes" that begin with 2, 8 or 9. For example, '812' will get padded to '0812'. This is allowed as some spreadsheet applications strip leading 0's.Â </li>
