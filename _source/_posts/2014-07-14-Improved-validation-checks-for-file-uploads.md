<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>We are seeking to improve the quality of ATAPS data and have therefore identified several areas where file upload checks can be improved. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Children referral type is only allowed for persons 15 years or younger. Errors will be generated when trying to add a Children type referral for a person 16 years or older.</li>
<li>The Paediatrician referrer type is only allowed for persons 15 years or younger. Errors will be generated when trying to add a Paediatrician referrer type for a person 16 years or older.</li>
</ul>
<p>These checks will commence as of 19 August and will apply to all referrals.</p>
<p>The data specifications are outlined on the Upload File Format documentation for referrals: <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html#referrals-upload-format" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/file-format/#referrals-upload-format</a></p>
<p>If you are having difficulty using the ATAPS minimum dataset, Strategic Data Pty Ltd maintain the <a href="../../../index.html" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/</a> website. This includes a list of frequently asked questions and their answers at <a href="../../user-documentation/faq/index.html" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/faq/</a>. So if you have a question, maybe there's an answer already. This is a live document and is therefore regularly updated.</p>
