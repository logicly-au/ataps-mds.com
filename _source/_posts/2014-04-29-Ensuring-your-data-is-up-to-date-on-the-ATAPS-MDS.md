<p>Dear Medicare Local ATAPS Project Officers,</p>
<p>The Evaluation team would like to let you know that we will be providing the Commonwealth Department of Health with a data report in May. The data will include referrals and sessions from 2014, so if you have not entered data for this year now is the time. We will be downloading the data at 9am on Monday the 5th of May.</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued efforts to keep the MDS as complete and up to date as possible.</p>
<p> Kind regards</p>
