<p>Dear ATAPS Coordinator,</p>
<p>Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) Minimum Dataset upgrades and additional information</p>
<h2>Introduction of mandatory <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>, postcode and ‘no show’ fields in the MDS</h2>
<p>On the 1 June 2013 the Statistical Linkage Key (<a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK</a>), the GP and patient postcode fields and the 'no show' field will be made mandatory in the Minimum Dataset.</p>
<p>The purpose of the SLK is to maintain greater accuracy of patient data, within and across Medicare Locals (MLs). The SLK provides the capacity to estimate the proportion of repeat clients across time in order to support more accurate reporting of repeat vs new clients being serviced. This capacity also helps managers to allocate resources according to program requirements (e.g. limits to the maximum number of sessions per client per 12 month period).</p>
<p>A number of MLs have expressed concerns around privacy issues and the SLK. One concern is that ATAPS Mental Health Professionals would need to supply name and date of birth information to the ML in order to generate the SLK. In order to solve this, an SLK generator is now available at:</p>
<p><a href="https://ataps-mds.net/slk">https://ataps-mds.net/slk</a></p>
<p>ATAPS Mental Health Professionals can use this to generate an SLK for inclusion in materials sent to the ML instead of providing personal details.</p>
<p>Another concern was that the SLK includes enough of a person's details (parts of their name, their gender, and date of birth) that they may still be identifiable. In order to alleviate this, the SLK can be provided, and is always stored, as a meaningless looking string of characters via a 'hashing' algorithm similar to those used by secure computer systems to protect user passwords. This hashed SLK can then be compared in the same way the non-hashed SLK can.</p>
<p>Further information about SLKs, including how to generate them, can be found in the <a href="../../mds-updates/slk/index.html">SLK documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Postcodes are to become mandatory in order to derive a measure of 'remoteness' for each referral. This measure will help evaluators and funders of the program better understand how remoteness impacts access to services.</p>
<p>The 'no show' field is to become mandatory as it contributes to efficiency-related reporting.</p>
<h2>Further information on the MDS</h2>
<p>At the recent ATAPS Child Mental Health Workshop, a number of issues were raised relating to the MDS. Some of these were general concerns and some were specific problems encountered in working with the MDS. We hope that the information below will update you on the resolution of some of these issues. Strategic Data, who are responsible for administering the MDS, are working to make the changes necessary to maintain pace with changes to the ATAPS program.</p>
<p>Entering more than one session for the same patient on the same day</p>
<p>1. Issue raised: The MDS does not allow more than one session to be entered for an individual patient for a single day. This is problematic for the Suicide Prevention program in particular.</p>
<p>Currently the MDS will not allow users to upload data on more than one session for the same patient on the same day. This issue only affects users who upload their data, not those who enter it manually. Those who enter data manually are able to enter more than session per patient per day.</p>
<p>A permanent solution to this problem is being sought by Strategic Data.</p>
<p>However, for those who upload the data, rather than enter it manually, there is one way to work around this problem until a permanent solution can be found:</p>
<ul>
<li>upload the first of the patient’s sessions for the day in question</li>
<li>then manually enter the subsequent sessions for the same patient, same day, using the online interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this will take a little longer, it is one way to ensure the data is entered correctly while we work on another solution.</p>
<h2>Data options for Child Mental Health Services</h2>
<p>2. Issue raised: Some of the data options in the MDS do not match the Operational Guidelines for the provision of ATAPS Child Mental Health Services.</p>
<p>Changes to the MDS related to the CMHS are being altered as a matter of priority. The new data options will be aligned with the CMHS guidelines and are being worked on now.</p>
<h2>Extreme Climatic Events</h2>
<p>3. Issue raised: There were some questions raised about not having access to an appropriate referral type for ATAPS services data where sessions have been provided to people experiencing severe climatic events.</p>
<p>Historically, only Medicare Locals who have received funding to provide ATAPS services to people affected by extreme climatic events had access to the 'Extreme Climatic Events' Referral type in the MDS.</p>
<p>An alteration to the 'Extreme Climatic Events'(ECE) Referral Type in the MDS will soon occur. This change will mean that all Medicare Locals will see the Referral Type options ‘Tier 2 ECE Flood/Cyclone’, ‘Tier 2 ECE Bushfire’, and ‘Tier 2 ECE Other’. While these referral types will be accessible to all Medicare Locals, they should only be used by those who have received specific funding for provision of services related to these Extreme Climatic Events.</p>
<p>This is one of several MDS issues that will be solved by a May 2013 deadline.</p>
<h2>Entering data from most used referrers and AHPros</h2>
<p>4. Issue raised: Previously there had been an issue with having to scroll down a list of all referrers and AHPros ever entered into the MDS for your Division/Medicare Local to find those that you use most commonly.</p>
<p>This issue was fixed at the end of last year. The input for referrers and AHPros for sessions is a now a "combobox" that allows both text input with autocomplete and a standard dropdown functionality.</p>
<p>Data entry users can type the first two or three characters of the referrer nickname and then select from a short list of referrers matching those characters OR Type the whole referrer nickname OR Use the list of all referrers in the organisation (which is often long).</p>
<p>As well as being able to locate referrers and AHPros more quickly, this also alerts users to any similar codes, in the case where typos or duplication of codes is being attempted in error.</p>
<h2>MDS reporting to Department of Health and Ageing</h2>
<p>5. Issue raised: MDS reporting</p>
<p>Strategic Data are also working on creating an option for Medicare Locals to be able to extract the MDS data they need for reporting to the Department using a standard function from the MDS. This will reduce the amount of work needed in regular reporting.</p>
<p>We will continue to work to update you on the various upgrades to the MDS that are currently being worked on and that will become active in the coming months.</p>
<p>If you are having some difficulty with using the MDS, Strategic Data Ltd maintain the https://ataps-mds.com/ website, which has an extensive <a href="../../user-documentation/faq/index.html">FAQ’s section</a>. This is a live document and is therefore consistently updated.</p>
