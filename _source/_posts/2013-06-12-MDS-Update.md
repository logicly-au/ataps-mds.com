<p>MDS Update 4.146 has been released.</p>
<p>In order to assist Medicare Locals who have not entered data previous to 1st of June, 2013 we have made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patient</strong> data can be entered without an SLK. However, you can not add a <strong>referral</strong> dated on or after 1st of June, 2013 unless the patient does have an SLK (unless a Department of Health and Ageing exemption has been granted).</li>
<li>
<p>Referrals: postcode and referrer_postcode are required if the referral date is on or after 1st of June, 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sessions: no_show is required if the session date is on or after 1st of June, 2013.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After clarification from the Department of Health and Ageing the following initiatives will now accept the 'No formal diagnosis' option:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 2 ECE - Flood/Cyclone</li>
<li>Children</li>
<li>ATSI Suicide prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation at <a href="../../technical-documentation/file-format/index.html" target="_blank">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/technical-documentation/file-format/</a> has been updated to reflect these changes.</p>
