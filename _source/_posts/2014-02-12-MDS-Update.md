<p>MDS Update 4.162 has been released. Below is a summary of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>User accounts must have unique email addresses. As email addresses may be used to login to the MDS, these must be unique in order to map to a single account. This restriction also applies to email addresses associated with Mental Health Professionals. We will shortly be contacting Medicare Locals where duplicate email addresses exist and helping them to clean up their user accounts.Â </li>
</ul>
