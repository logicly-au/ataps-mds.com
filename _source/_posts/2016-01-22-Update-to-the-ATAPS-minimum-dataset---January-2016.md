<p>MDS Update v4.193 was released on January 21, 2016.</p>
<p>Service Level matrix reports are now available under the 'Report selection' page.</p>
<p>There are two Service Level matrix reports intended for use by organisations in their departmental reporting. One report summarises activity by counting attended sessions; the other indicates the number of patients in receipt of sessions delivered by service providers funded/commissioned by the organisation.</p>
<p>Service Level matrix reports can be used to generate the reports required by The Department of Health for KPI 3.2a/b and c.</p>
<p>The documentation at <a href="../../user-documentation/user-guide/reports/index.html" target="_top">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/user-guide/reports/</a> has been updated to reflect theses changes.</p>
