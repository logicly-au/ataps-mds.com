<p>Beginning the 1st of July a process to amalgamate Medicare Locals into 31 Primary Health Networks will begin. The MDS system will be made ready for the transition by that time. This <a href="../../user-documentation/transition-of-mls-to-phns/index.html">process</a> is expected to be largely complete by early August. The data required for the MDS will remain largely the same, notwithstanding minor changes that occur when changes to programs are made which require new data to be captured. <a href="../../user-documentation/transition-of-mls-to-phns/index.html">More information &gt;&gt;</a></p>    <div id='last-modified'>
