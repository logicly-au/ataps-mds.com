<p>Dear Medicare Locals,</p>
<p>Please be advised that data will be extracted for various evaluation reports on 30 April, 31 July and 30 September, 2015.</p>
<p>However, the Department often request reports without any notice and it is therefore recommended that ATAPS data is kept as up to date as possible at all times, at minimum monthly.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>The ATAPS Evaluation Team</p>
