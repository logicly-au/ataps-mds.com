    <h1>Option 1: Access to Mental Health Workforce Data by Medicare Local Staff</h1>
<p>MDS Users can edit the current data for each Mental Health Professional by following the instructions at <a href="../../../user-documentation/user-guide/ataps-help-mental-health-professional-data/index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/user-guide/ataps-help-mental-health-professional-data/</a> </p>
<p>You will need to follow these steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean up the existing MHPro data that is stored in the MDS. Due to data entry inaccuracy some MHPros have been entered in the MDS multiple times.</li>
<li>To obtain a report on the MHPros currently stored in the MDS for your Medical Local, click ‘Manage MHPros’ and then click ‘Download list of MHPros’. This will download a spreadsheet file which contains a list of all the MHPros in your Medicare Local, the MHPro's email address, their most recent session date, when their Mental Health Workforce Data was last updated and a unique link to their Mental Health Workforce Data update page. The spreadsheet file is suitable for opening and editing in Excel or any spreadsheet application.</li>
<li>Using this report identify any MHPros that have been entered into the MDS multiple times. Decide which code is correct and then using the instructions at <a href="../../../user-documentation/faq/index.html#How_do_I_merge_a_duplicate_MHP_or_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/faq/#How_do_I_merge_a_duplicate_MHP_or_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63</a> merge the incorrect codes into the correct code.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="../../../../site/assets/files/1096/mental_health_professional_data_collection_information_option_1.doc">Information for MHPros Option 1</a> document, please fill in the return email/fax details</li>
<li>Send the updated Information for MHPros Option 1 document and the attached <a href="../../../../site/assets/files/1096/mental_health_professional_data_for_the_ataps_minimum_dataset.pdf">data collection form</a> to your MHPros that have given a session since January 2012. Request them to have the forms returned by a date that will allow you to have the data entered in the MDS by Friday 22nd of November 2013.</li>
<li>When the MHPros return the form, enter the data on to the MDS using the instructions above.</li>
<li>Follow-up all MHPros so that data is complete in the MDS by <strong>Friday 22</strong><strong>nd</strong><strong> of November 2013.</strong></li>
