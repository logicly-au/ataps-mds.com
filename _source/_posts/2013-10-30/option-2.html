    <h1>Option 2: Self access to Mental Health Workforce Data</h1>
<p><strong> </strong>Mental Health Workforce Data can also be entered directly by the MHPro. We have created unique links into the MDS for each MHPro that allows them to edit their details without the need to login. The intention is that a central liaison within the Medicare Local, who has MDS access, can download these links from the MDS and then issue them via email to the relevant MHPros to update their own data. The Medicare Local can then use this list to monitor which Mental Health Professionals have filled in their profile details and who requires follow up. </p>
<p>The following steps explain how this process works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean up the existing MHPro data that is stored in the MDS. Due to data entry inaccuracy some MHPros have been entered in the MDS multiple times.</li>
<li>To obtain a report on the MHPros currently stored in the MDS for your Medical Local, click ‘Manage MHPros’ and then click ‘Download list of MHPros’. This will download a spreadsheet file which contains a list of all the MHPros in your Medicare Local, the MHPro's email address, their most recent session date, when their Mental Health Workforce Data was last updated and a unique link to their Mental Health Workforce Data update page. The spreadsheet file is suitable for opening and editing in Excel or any spreadsheet application.</li>
<li>Using this report identify any MHPros that have been entered into the MDS multiple times. Decide which code is correct and then using the instructions at <a href="../../../user-documentation/faq/index.html#How_do_I_merge_a_duplicate_MHP_or_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63">https://ataps-mds.com/mds/user-documentation/faq/#How_do_I_merge_a_duplicate_MHP_or_referrer_code_in_the_MDS_63</a> merge the incorrect codes into the correct code.</li>
<li>Once you have cleaned up your MHPro data re-download the list of MHPros.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="../../../../site/assets/files/1097/mental_health_professional_data_collection_information_option_2.doc">supplied email template</a>, email each Mental Health Professional that has given a session since January 2012. Please substitute their unique link from the spreadsheet at the appropriate location before sending. </li>
<li>Follow-up MHPros who don’t complete their data so that all information is up to date by <strong>Friday 22</strong><strong>nd</strong><strong> of November 2013.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If Medicare Locals would like assistance in emailing details of the Mental Health Workforce Data to their Mental Health Professionals please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> by <strong>Friday 15</strong><strong>th</strong><strong> November. </strong></p>
