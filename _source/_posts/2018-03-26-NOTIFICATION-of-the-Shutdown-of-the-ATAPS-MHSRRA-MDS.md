<p>NOTIFICATION of the Shutdown of the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS</p>

<p><em>The ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS will be shut down on Monday 6 August 2018.</em>  After 6 August 2018 all data must be entered into the PMHC MDS.</p>

<p>The ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS has been kept online to allow existing client referrals received prior to 1 July 2017 under the old ATAPS/MHSRRA system to be maintained until all sessions associated with that referral were complete. As of 1 July 2017 only new sessions for these existing clients were to be entered into the old ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS. No new clients or referrals were to be entered into the system.</p>

<p>All referrals entered into the ATAPS/MHSRRA MDS prior to 1 July 2017 are expected to have completed their ATAPS/MHSRRA sessions by 30 June 2018 and have their data entered into the ATAPS/MHRRSA MDS prior to the system being shut down on 6 August 2018. Should the client require continuing services beyond 30 June 2018, the service provider or PHN should make arrangements for the client to be reregistered through the PMHC MDS.</p>

<p><em>Any new referrals made after 1 July 2017 should have been entered into the new Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set (PMHC MDS).</em></p>
