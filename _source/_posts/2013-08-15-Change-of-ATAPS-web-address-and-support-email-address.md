<p>The Department of Health and Ageing has asked us to change all our documentation to refer to Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) rather than Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care (BOiMHC) to reflect the contemporary naming of the program.</p>
<p>We have been updating all of the websites to conform with this change. This includes changing the web address of both the ATAPS documentation and the ATAPS minimum dataset and changing the support email address.</p>
<p>The following changes have now been implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>The documentation website at <a href="https://boimhc.org/">https://boimhc.org/</a> has been moved to <a href="../../../index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/</a></li>
<li>The ATAPS minimum dataset website at <a href="https://secure.boimhc.org/">https://secure.boimhc.org/</a> has been moved to <a href="https://ataps-mds.net/">https://ataps-mds.net/</a></li>
<li>The support email address is now <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The old web addresses still continue to work, but will redirect you to the new addresses. Please use the new addresses. At some point in the future we may remove the old addresses.</p>
<p>The ATAPS minimum dataset can still be accessed by navigating to <a href="../../../index.html">https://ataps-mds.com/</a> and clicking the 'MDS Login' link.</p>
<p>The old <a href="mailto:support@boimhc.org">support@boimhc.org</a> will also still work, but once again, please use the new <a href="mailto:support@ataps-mds.com">support@ataps-mds.com</a> address, as at some point in the future we may discontinue <a href="mailto:support@boimhc.org">support@boimhc.org</a>.</p>
